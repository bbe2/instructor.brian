As an instructor, I cover foundational computing from machine and assembly with LC-3 via [patt/patel](https://www.mheducation.com/highered/product/introduction-computing-systems-bits-gates-c-c-beyond-patt-patel/M9781260150537.html) to C++. My expertise also spans theoretical system design, practical re-engineering, data transformation and programming constructs, and STEM communication, complemented by my data science training and course authorship, like COSC-526 data mining with Spark.

I employ an active learning pedagogy, leveraging tools like Colab, G Sheets, and Github. Taking inspiration from bee festooning, students collaborate in JAMs, linking concepts and tackling challenges, like analyzing a physical book's word count within an hour. My aim? Equip students with immediate, tangible skills for preparedness during **`unREAL`** talent and task replacement.

An embodiment of a Lacanian real, a [Krokeresque](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=kihLEAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PP1&dq=kroker+technology+of+the+new+real&ots=ToOQ2Gin0M&sig=UcVo6hKR9ytEUls5MYfygvG8cVQ#v=onepage&q=kroker%20technology%20of%20the%20new%20real&f=false) **`new.REAL`** is central to my teaching paradigm. Education is a performative act, lived and crafted, not just passively consumed. The paradigm challenges traditional passive learning and draws on Arthur Kroker's concept of body drift, i.e., a blend of humanity with technology and Foucault's active knowledge structures. Students don't absorb but actively shape, create, and immerse themselves where education isn't symbolic but a tangible, actionable commodity echoing Baudrillard's simulacrum. Efforts showcase immediate skills and the use of abstraction to discern situational mechanics. 

To augment classroom learning, I use GPT APIs to,  
A.	Summarize the audio lecture and lecture notes.  
B.	Identify and synthesize disparities between audio lectures and lecture notes.  
C.	Email outcomes and then aggregate all media into a central repository.  
D.	Harness substrate for bespoke AI.agent development, enabling students to pose intricate curriculum-related queries for precise answers.   
#=> My work centers on furthering accessibility and recall mnemonics.
