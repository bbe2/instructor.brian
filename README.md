• Technical Writing with ChatGPT (new)			March 2023  
Two of my students used ChatGPT to pass exams last semester. Neither delivered work in their voice. Applying NLP training from linguistic expert Dr. Nancy McCracken, the course instructs on the principals, mechanics, and Python code with ChatGPT to  
a)	Assess metrics representing originality discourse (authentic self).  
b)	Upscale information exchange quality with polysyllabic trees by ontology.  
c) Learn expegesis techniques.  
c)	Deepen one’s love of language and self expression of situations.

**Inspiration**
“There are two types of genius. Ordinary geniuses do great things, but they leave you room to believe you could do the same if only you worked hard enough.  Then there are magicians, and you can have no idea how they do it. Feynman was a magician.”  
->Nuclear Physicist Hans Bethe
