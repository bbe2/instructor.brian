```
I equip students with immediate, tangible  
skills and preparedness to exceed employer  
expectations on day 1. 

Currently, I instruct foundational compute from  
machine and assembly with LC-3 via patt/patel to C++.  
My expertise spans theoretical system design,  
practical re-engineering, data transformation,  
essential programming, and STEM communication.  
I'm grateful for my quality master's in data  
science that upskilled my ability to author  
graduate courses like COSC-526 data mining with Spark.  

An active learning pedagogy complements my
instruction by leveraging Colab, Google Sheets,
and Github. Drawing inspiration from
bee festooning, students collaborate in weekly
JAMs, linking root concepts for effective task
decomposition like being handed a book and
having an hour to create tables of all chapters
and words for text and machine learning.

An embodiment of a Lacanian real, a Krokeresque
new.REAL is central to my teaching paradigm.
Education is a performative act, lived and crafted,
not passively consumed. This paradigm challenges
passive learning and draws on Arthur Kroker's
concept of body drift, i.e., a blend of humanity
with technology and Foucault's active knowledge
structures. Students don't absorb but actively
shape, create, and immerse themselves. Education
isn't a symbolic un.REAL but a tangible,
actionable commodity echoing Baudrillard's simulacra.
The new.REAL demands deeper requiring use of
abstraction and ontological formation skilling.

Augment student learning and engagement is furthered
 using generative pretrained transformers that
a) Convert lecture audio to text and integrate
=> into class corpus.
b) Use GPT tech to synthesize disparities, including
=> lecture notes and textbooks.
c) Email disparity index and aggregate media
=> into a central repository.  
d) Feed repository into a course specific AI agent,
=> further supporting student tasks.
e) Facilitate upskilling and recall mnemonics
=> while experiencing a new.REAL of our social fabric.
