**abstraction**  
• writing technique providing a tangential view of a situation -b.hogan definition(of sorts)  
• habitual evocation of parallel structure  
• a tendency to place feelings in syntactic positions of agency  
• a trick of underplaying causal words: any of these patterns of expression, when repeated with unusual frequency, is the sign of a habit of meaning, and thus of a persistent way of sorting out the phenomena of experience.  

• ...almost beyond the power of language to describe  
• ...a sentence begins by raising rather than answering questions  
• ...As the sentence progresses, some of its demands are satisfied, others deferred, others complicated, and mean while new ones are created. But with the end of the sentence comes a kind of balance which results from something having been said.  

abtraction example:  
"the little black desk at the window was black, rivaling the blackness of this fire escape, those rails dipped in asphalt, a heavy cosemetic coat of black, raills equidistant but appearcing according to the rules of perspective. - suall bellow, Herzog, p.128 <tufte.p.156>
