Hello! I focus on equipping students
with system and data skills and expert
coding abilities for information synthesis.

At present, I instruct foundational computer
science topics, ranging from machine and
assembly to C++ via  patt/patel. My expertise
spans theoretical system design, practical
re-engineering, data transformation in Python
and R, STEM communication, and curriculum
development. I'm grateful for my quality
master's in applied data science which enhanced
my ability to develop quality graduate courses like
COSC-526 Data Mining with Spark, at www.utk.edu.

My teaching philosophy emphasizes active
learning through tools like Colab, Google
Sheets, and Github. Students engage in weekly
JAMs, connecting fundamental concepts, such
as converting physical books into Python
data objects. I provide codebooks in every
class to expose students to algorithms,
statistical analysis, and machine learning,
similar to work performed in the Coursera
module  Get Started with Python in Googleâ€™s
advanced data analytics course.

I transform course materials into interactive
workspaces, integrating theory, methods, and
programming into workable learning objects and
codebooks. Students actively reshape information
into actionable Baudrillard commodities, preparing
them for relationships with generative pretrained
transformer (GPT) bots and AI agents focused on the
ontological formation and advanced solving.
The Krokeresque new.REAL may lead to unprecedented
job elimination through the democratization of GPT.
To facilitate upskilling and recall mnemonics,
my teaching infrastructure includes

a)	Converting lecture audio to text and integrating it into the class corpus.
b)	Employing GPT tech to synthesize disparities, including lecture notes and textbooks.
c)	Emailing the disparity index and aggregating media into a central repository.
d)	Feeding the repository into a course-specific AI agent, further supporting student tasks.
e)	Facilitating upskilling and recall mnemonics while immersing students in the tech/social fabric of a new.REAL
