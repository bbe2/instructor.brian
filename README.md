Instructor of undergraduate and graduate courses in  
- C++, Python, data mining, systems design/analysis, and technical communication.

In my classroom, I prioritize every student by promoting interactive learning and establishing a supportive environment to unlock their potential. I am resolute in evidencing their pillars of skills to form career sustainability. Each student possesses the substance to succeed, and I provide information repository methods and information assembly methods leading to a quality library facilitating grit and resilience in computer science.

Computer science, like many organic models, is adaptable. I’m passionate about studying how melittologic (bees) and arachnids adapt regarding vision, collaboration, and structure. These systems inspire design by illustrating critical endpoints like sustenance fulfillment, monitoring one's territory, and cleaning house. I incorporate these concepts into lectures and interactive materials to help expand student neuroplasticity.

“There are two types of genius. Ordinary geniuses do great things, but they leave you room to believe you could do the same if only you worked hard enough.  Then there are magicians, and you can have no idea how they do it. Feynman was a magician.”  
->Nuclear Physicist Hans Bethe
