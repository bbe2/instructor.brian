choice upon her ere my heart durst make too bold a herald of my tongue where the impression of mine eye infixing contempt his scornful perspective did lend me which warpd the line of every other favour scornd a fair colour or expressd it stolen extended or contracted all proportions to a most hideous object thence it came that she whom all men praised and whom myself since i have lost have loved was in mine eye the dust that did offend it hers it was not my gracious sovereign howeer it pleases you to take it so the ring was never hers you are deceived my lord she never saw it in florence was it from a casement thrown me wrappd in a paper which containd the name of her that threw it noble she was and thought i stood engaged but when i had subscribed to mine own fortune and informd her fully i could not answer in that course of honour as she had made the overture she ceased in heavy satisfaction and would never receive the ring again she never saw it if you shall prove this ring was ever hers you shall as easy prove that i husbanded her bed in florence where yet she never was my lord i neither can nor will deny but that i know them do they charge me further shes none of mine my lord my lord this is a fond and desperate creature whom sometime i have laughd with let your highness lay a more noble thought upon mine honour than for to think that i would sink it here shes impudent my lord and was a common gamester to the camp what of him hes quoted for a most perfidious slave with all the spots o the world taxd and deboshd whose nature sickens but to speak a truth am i or that or this for what hell utter that will speak any thing i think she has certain it is i liked her and boarded her i the wanton way of youth she knew her distance and did angle for me madding my eagerness with her restraint as all impediments in fancys course are motives of more fancy and in fine her infinite cunning with her modern grace subdued me to her rate she got the ring and i had that which any inferior might at marketprice have bought i have it not my lord i do confess the ring was hers both both o pardon if she my liege can make me know this clearly ill love her dearly ever ever dearlyyou shall find of the king a husband madam you sir a father he that so generally is at all times good must of necessity hold his virtue to you whose worthiness would stir it up where it wanted rather than lack it where there is such abundance he hath abandoned his physicians madam under whose practises he hath persecuted time with hope and finds no other advantage in the process but only the losing of hope by time how called you the man you speak of madam he was excellent indeed madam the king very lately spoke of him admiringly and mourningly he was skilful enough to have lived still if knowledge could be set up against mortality a fistula my lord i would it were not notorious was this gentlewoman the daughter of gerard de narbon your commendations madam get from her tears moderate lamentation is the right of the dead excessive grief the enemy to the living how understand we that he cannot want the best that shall attend his love farewell pretty lady you must hold the credit of your father kneeling  pardon my lord for me and for my tidings then heres a man stands that has brought his pardon i would you had kneeld my lord to ask me mercy and that at my bidding you could so stand up good faith across but my good lord tis thus will you be cured of your infirmity o will you eat no grapes my royal fox yes but you will my noble grapes an if my royal fox could reach them i have seen a medicine thats able to breathe life into a stone quicken a rock and make you dance canary with spritely fire and motion whose simple touch is powerful to araise king pepin nay to give great charlemain a pen ins hand and write to her a loveline why doctor she my lord theres one arrived if you will see her now by my faith and honour if seriously i may convey my thoughts in this my light deliverance i have spoke with one that in her sex her years profession wisdom and constancy hath amazed me more than i dare blame my weakness will you see her for that is her demand and

such traitors his majesty seldom fears i am cressids uncle that dare leave two together fare you well they say miracles are past and we have our philosophical persons to make modern and familiar things supernatural and causeless hence is it that we make trifles of terrors ensconcing ourselves into seeming knowledge when we should submit ourselves to an unknown fear to be relinquishd of the artists both of galen and paracelsus of all the learned and authentic fellows that gave him out incurable not to be helped uncertain life and sure death i may truly say it is a novelty to the world a showing of a heavenly effect in an earthly actor why your dolphin is not lustier fore me i speak in respect very hand of heaven in a most weak   and debile minister great power great transcendence

As You Like It,as i remember adam it was upon this fashion bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns and as thou sayest charged my brother on his blessing to breed me well and there begins my sadness my brother jaques he keeps at school and report speaks goldenly of his profit for my part he keeps me rustically at home or to speak more properly stays me here at home unkept for call you that keeping for a gentleman of my birth that differs not from the stalling of an ox his horses are bred better for besides that they are fair with their feeding they are taught their manage and to that end riders dearly hired but i his brother gain nothing under him but growth for the which his animals on his dunghills are as much bound to him as i besides this nothing that he so plentifully gives me the something that nature gave me his countenance seems to take from me he lets me feed with his hinds bars me the place of a brother and as much as in him lies mines my gentility with my education this is it adam that grieves me and the spirit of my father which i think is within me begins to mutiny against this servitude i will no longer endure it though yet i know no wise remedy how to avoid it go apart adam and thou shalt hear how he will shake me up nothing i am not taught to make any thing marry sir i am helping you to mar that which god made a poor unworthy brother of yours with idleness shall i keep your hogs and eat husks with them what prodigal portion have i spent that i should come to such penury o sir very well here in your orchard ay better than him i am before knows me i know you are my eldest brother and in the gentle condition of blood you should so know me the courtesy of nations allows you my better in that you are the firstborn but the same tradition

too young in this i am no villain i am the youngest son of sir rowland de boys he was my father and he is thrice a villain that says such a father begot villains wert thou not my brother i would not take this hand from thy throat till this other had pulled out thy tongue for saying so thou hast railed on thyself i will not till i please you shall hear me my father charged you in his will to give me good education you have trained me like a peasant obscuring and hiding from me all gentlemanlike qualities the spirit of my father grows strong in me and i will no longer endure it therefore allow me such exercises as may become a gentleman or give me the poor allottery my father left me by testament with that i will go buy my fortunes i will no further offend you than becomes me for my good i attend them with all respect and duty no fair princess he is the general challenger i come but in as others do to try with him the strength of my youth i beseech you punish me not with your hard thoughts wherein i confess me much guilty to deny so fair and excellent ladies any thing but let your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my trial wherein if i be foiled there is but one shamed that was never gracious if killed but one dead that was willing to be so i shall do my friends no wrong for i have none to lament me the world no injury for in it i have nothing only in the world i fill up a place which may be better supplied when i have made it empty ready sir but his will hath in it a more modest working an you mean to mock me after you should not have mocked me before but come your ways yes i beseech your grace i am not yet well breathed orlando my liege the youngest son of sir rowland de boys i am more proud to be sir rowlands son his youngest son and would not change

sadness my brother jaques he keeps at school and report speaks goldenly of his profit for my part he keeps me rustically at home or to speak more properly stays me here at home unkept for call you that keeping for a gentleman of my birth that differs not from the stalling of an ox his horses are bred better for besides that they are fair with their feeding they are taught their manage and to that end riders dearly hired but i his brother gain nothing under him but growth for the which his animals on his dunghills are as much bound to him as i besides this nothing that he so plentifully gives me the something that nature gave me his countenance seems to take from me he lets me feed with his hinds bars me the place of a brother and as much as in him lies mines my gentility with my

The Comedy of Errors,proceed solinus to procure my fall and by the doom of death end woes and all yet this my comfort when your words are done my woes end likewise with the evening sun a heavier task could not have been imposed than i to speak my griefs unspeakable yet that the world may witness that my end was wrought by nature not by vile offence ill utter what my sorrows give me leave in syracusa was i born and wed unto a woman happy but for me and by me had not our hap been bad with her i lived in joy our wealth increased by prosperous voyages i often made to epidamnum till my factors death and the great care of goods at random left drew me from kind embracements of my spouse from whom my absence was not six months old before herself almost at fainting under the pleasing punishment that women bear had made provision for her following me and soon and safe arrived where i was there had she not been long but she became a joyful mother of two goodly sons and which was strange the one so like the other as could not be distinguishd but by names that very hour and in the selfsame inn a meaner woman was delivered of such a burden male twins both alike thosefor their parents were exceeding poor i bought and brought up to attend my sons my wife not meanly proud of two such boys made daily motions for our home return unwilling i agreed alas too soon we came aboard a league from epidamnum had we saild before the always windobeying deep gave any tragic instance of our harm but longer did we not retain much hope for what obscured light the heavens did grant did but convey unto our fearful minds a doubtful warrant of immediate death which though myself would gladly have embraced yet the incessant weepings of my wife weeping before for what she saw must come and piteous plainings of the pretty babes that mournd for fashion ignorant what to fear forced me to seek delays for them and me and this it was for other means was none the sailors sought for safety by our boat and left the ship then sinkingripe to us my wife more careful for the latterborn had fastend him unto a small spare mast such as seafaring men provide for storms to him one of the other twins was bound whilst i had been like heedful of the other the children thus disposed my wife and i fixing our eyes on whom our care was fixd fastend ourselves at either end the mast and floating straight obedient to the stream was carried towards corinth as we thought at length the sun gazing upon the earth dispersed those vapours that offended us and by the benefit of his wished light the seas waxd calm and we discovered two ships from far making amain to us of corinth that of epidaurus this but ere they cameo let me say no more gather the sequel by that went before o had the gods done so i had not now worthily termd them merciless to us for ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues we were encounterd by a mighty rock which being violently borne upon our helpful ship was splitted in the midst so that in this unjust divorce of us fortune had left to both of us alike what to delight in what to sorrow for her part poor soul seeming as burdened with lesser weight but not with lesser woe was carried with more speed before the wind and in our sight they three were taken up by fishermen of corinth as we thought at length another ship had seized on us and knowing whom it was their hap to save gave healthful welcome to their shipwreckd guests and would have reft the fishers of their prey had not their bark been very slow of sail and therefore homeward did they bend their course thus have you heard me severd from my bliss that by misfortunes was my life prolongd to tell sad stories of my own mishaps my youngest boy and yet my eldest care at eighteen years became inquisitive after his brother and importuned me that his attendantso his case was like reft of his brother but retaind his name might bear him company in the quest of him whom whilst i labourd of a love to see i hazarded the loss of whom i loved five summers have i spent in furthest greece roaming clean through the bounds of asia and coasting homeward came to ephesus hopeless to find yet loath to leave unsought or that or any place that harbours men but here must end the story of my life and happy were i in my timely death could all my travels warrant me they live hopeless and helpless doth aegeon wend but to procrastinate his lifeless end unless the fear of death doth make me dote i see my son antipholus and dromio antipholus most mighty duke vouchsafe me speak a word haply i see a friend will save my life and pay the sum that may deliver me is not your name sir calld antipholus and is not that your bondman dromio i am sure you both of you remember me why look you strange on me you know me well o grief hath changed me since you saw me last and careful hours with times deformed hand have written strange defeatures in my face but tell me yet dost thou not know my voice antipholus dromio nor thou i am sure thou dost not know my voice o times extremity hast thou so crackd and splitted my poor tongue in seven short years that here my only son knows not my feeble key of untuned cares though now this grained face of mine be hid in sapconsuming winters drizzled snow and all the conduits of my blood froze up yet hath my night of life some memory my wasting lamps some fading glimmer left my dull deaf ears a little use to hear all these old witnessesi cannot err tell me thou art my son antipholus antipholus but seven years since in syracusa boy thou knowst we parted but perhaps my son thou shamest to acknowledge me in misery antipholus if i dream not thou art aemilia if thou art she tell me where is that son that floated with thee on the fatal raftmerchant of syracuse plead no more i am not partial to infringe our laws the enmity and discord which of late sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke to merchants our welldealing countrymen who wanting guilders to redeem their lives have seald his rigorous statutes with their bloods excludes all pity from our threatening looks for since the mortal and intestine jars twixt thy seditious countrymen and us it hath in solemn synods been decreed both by the syracusians and ourselves to admit no traffic to our adverse towns nay more if any born at ephesus be seen at any syracusian marts and fairs again if any syracusian born come to the bay of ephesus he dies his goods confiscate to the dukes dispose unless a thousand marks be levied to quit the penalty and to ransom him thy substance valued at the highest rate cannot amount unto a hundred marks therefore by law thou art condemned to die well syracusian say in brief the cause why thou departedst from thy native home and for what cause thou camest to ephesus and for the sake of them thou sorrowest for do me the favour to dilate at full what hath befalln of them and thee till now hapless aegeon whom the fates have markd to bear the extremity of dire mishap now trust me were it not against our laws against my crown my oath my dignity which princes would they may not disannul my soul would sue as advocate for thee but though thou art adjudged to the death and passed sentence may not be recalld but to our honours great disparagement yet i will favour thee in what i can therefore merchant ill limit thee this day to seek thy life by

Cymbeline,you do not meet a man but frowns our bloods no more obey the heavens than our courtiers still seem as does the king his daughter and the heir ofs kingdom whom he purposed to his wifes sole sona widow that late he marriedhath referrd herself unto a poor but worthy gentleman shes wedded her husband banishd she imprisond all is outward sorrow though i think the king be touchd at very heart he that hath lost her too so is the queen that most desired the match but not a courtier although they wear their faces to the bent of the kings looks hath a heart that is not glad at the thing they scowl at you speak him far i do extend him sir within himself crush him together rather than unfold his measure duly whats his name and birth how long is this ago some twenty years that a kings children should be so conveyd so slackly guarded and the search so slow that could not trace them i do well believe you we must forbear here comes the gentleman the queen and princessbut whats the matter none but the king and why so i honour him even out of your report but pray you tell me is she sole child to the kinghe that hath missd the princess is a thing too bad for bad report and he that hath her i mean that married her alack good man and therefore banishdis a creature such as to seek through the regions of the earth for one his like there would be something failing in him that should compare i do not think so fair an outward and such stuff within endows a man but he i cannot delve him to the root his father was calld sicilius who did join his honour against the romans with cassibelan but had his titles by tenantius whom he served with glory and admired success so gaind the suraddition leonatus and had besides this gentleman in question two other sons who in the wars o the time died with their swords in hand for which their father then old and fond of issue took such sorrow that he quit being and his gentle lady big of this gentleman our theme deceased as he was born the king he takes the babe to his protection calls him posthumus leonatus breeds him and makes him of his bedchamber puts to him all the learnings that his time could make him the receiver of which he took as we do air fast as twas ministerd and ins spring became a harvest lived in court which rare it is to domost praised most loved a sample to the youngest to the more mature a glass that feated them and to the graver a child that guided dotards to his mistress for whom he now is banishd her own price proclaims how she esteemd him and his virtue by her election may be truly read what kind of man he is his only child he had two sons if this be worth your hearing mark it the eldest of them at three years old i the swathingclothes the other from their nursery were stoln and to this hour no guess in knowledge which way they went howsoeer tis strange or that the negligence may well be laughd at yet is it true sirno be assured you shall not find me daughter after the slander of most stepmothers evileyed unto you youre my prisoner but your gaoler shall deliver you the keys that lock up your restraint for you posthumus so soon as i can win the offended king i will be known your advocate marry yet the fire of rage is in him and twere good you leand unto his sentence with what patience your wisdom may inform you you know the peril ill fetch a turn about the garden pitying the pangs of barrd affections though the king hath charged you should not speak together be brief i pray you if the king come i shall incur i know not how much of his displeasure   yet ill move him to walk this way i never do him wrong but he does buy my injuries to be friends pays dear for my offences beseech your patience peace dear lady daughter peace sweet sovereign leave us to ourselves and make yourself some comfort out of your best advice fie you must give way   here is your servant how now sir what news ha no harm i trust is done i am very glad ont this hath been your faithful servant i dare lay mine honour he will remain so pray walk awhile whiles yet the dews on ground gather those flowers make haste who has the note of them dispatch   now master doctor have you brought those drugs i wonder doctor thou askst me such a question have i not been thy pupil long hast thou not learnd me how to make perfumes distil preserve yea so that our great king himself doth woo me oft for my confections having thus far proceeded unless thou thinkst me devilishist not meet that i did amplify my judgment in other conclusions i will try the forces of these thy compounds on such creatures as we count not worth the hanging but none human to try the vigour of them and apply allayments to their act and by them gather their several virtues and effects o content thee     here comes a flattering rascal upon him will i first work hes for his master an enemy to my son how now pisanio doctor your service for this time is ended take your own way to pisanio            hark thee a word no further service doctor until i send for thee weeps she still sayst thou dost thou think in time she will not quench and let instructions enter where folly now possesses do thou work when thou shalt bring me word she loves my son ill tell thee on the instant thou art then as great as is thy master greater for his fortunes all lie speechless and his name is at last gasp return he cannot nor continue where he is to shift his being is to exchange one misery with another and every day that comes comes to decay a days work in him what shalt thou expect to be depender on a thing that leans who cannot be new built nor has no friends so much as but to prop him   thou takest up thou knowst not what but take it for thy labour it is a thing i made which hath the king five times redeemd from death i do not know what is more cordial nay i prethee take it it is an earnest of a further good that i mean to thee tell thy mistress how the case stands with her dot as from thyself think what a chance thou changest on but think thou hast thy mistress still to boot my son who shall take notice of thee ill move the king to any shape of thy preferment such as thoult desire and then myself i chiefly that set thee on to this desert am bound to load thy merit richly call my women think on my words   a sly and constant knave not to be shaked the agent for his master and the remembrancer of her to hold the handfast to her lord i have given him that which if he take shall quite unpeople her of liegers for her sweet and which she after except she bend her humour shall be assured to taste of too   so so well done well done the violets cowslips and the primroses bear to my closet fare thee well pisanio think on my words you are most bound to the king who lets go by no vantages that may prefer you to his daughter frame yourself to orderly soliciting and be friended with aptness of the season make denials increase your services so seem as if you were inspired to do those duties which you tender to her that you in all obey her save when command to your dismission tends and therein you are senseless and to kill the marvel shall be so ever that opportunity which then they had to take from s to resume we have again remember sir my liege the kings your ancestors together with the natural bravery of your isle which stands as neptunes park ribbed and paled in with rocks unscalable and roaring waters with sands that will not bear your enemies boats but suck them up to the topmast a kind of conquest caesar made here but made not here his brag of came and saw and overcame  with shame that first that ever touchd himhe was carried from off our coast twice beaten and his shipping poor ignorant baubles upon our terrible seas like eggshells moved upon their surges crackd as easily gainst our rocks for joy whereof the famed cassibelan who was once at point o giglot fortuneto master caesars sword made luds town with rejoicing fires bright and britons strut with courage and you he goes hence frowning but it honours us that we have given him cause tis not sleepy business but must be lookd to speedily and strongly royal sir since the exile of posthumus most retired hath her life been the cure whereof my lord tis time must do beseech your majesty forbear sharp speeches to her shes a lady so tender of rebukes that words are strokes and strokes death to her my lord when last i went to visit her she prayd me to excuse her keeping close whereto constraind by her infirmity she should that duty leave unpaid to you which daily she was bound to proffer this she wishd me to make known but our great court made me to blame in memory son i say follow the king go look after   pisanio thou that standst so for posthumus he hath a drug of mine i pray his absence proceed by swallowing that for he believes it is a thing most precious but for her where is she gone haply despair hath seized her or wingd with fervor of her love shes flown to her desired posthumus gone she is to death or to dishonour and my end can make good use of either she being down i have the placing of the british crown   how now my son aside            all the better may this night forestall him of the coming dayplease your highness i will from hence today should we be taking leave as long a term as yet we have to live the loathness to depart would grow adieu how how another you gentle gods give

so infinite loss so in our trifles i still win of you for my sake wear this it is a manacle of love ill place it upon this fairest prisoner alack the king the gods protect you and bless the good remainders of the court i am gone since when i have been debtor to you for courtesies which i will be ever to pay and yet pay still by your pardon sir i was then a young traveller rather shunned to go

lying note it the womans flattering hers deceiving hers lust and rank thoughts hers hers revenges hers ambitions covetings change of prides disdain nice longing slanders mutability all faults that may be named nay that hell knows why hers in part or all but rather all for even to vice they are not constant but are changing still one vice but of a minute old for one not half so old as that ill write against them detest them curse them yet tis greater skill in a true hate to pray they have their will the very devils cannot plague them better yea bloody cloth ill keep thee for i wishd thou shouldst be colourd thus you married ones if each of you should take this course how many must murder wives much better than themselves for wrying but a little o pisanio every good servant does not all commands no bond but to do just ones gods if you should have taen vengeance on my faults i never had lived to put on this so had you saved the noble imogen to repent and struck me wretch more worth your vengeance but alack you snatch some hence for little faults thats love to have them fall no more you some permit to second ills with ills each elder worse and make them dread it to the doers thrift but imogen is your own do your best wills and make me blest to obey i am brought hither among the italian gentry and to fight against my ladys kingdom tis enough that britain i have killd thy mistress peace ill give no wound to thee therefore good heavens hear patiently my purpose ill disrobe me of these italian weeds and suit myself as does a briton peasant so ill fight against the part i come with so ill die for thee o imogen even for whom my life is every breath a death and thus unknown pitied nor hated to the face of peril myself ill dedicate let me make men know more valour in me than my habits show gods put the strength o the leonati in me to shame the guise o the world i will begin the fashion less without and more within i did though you it seems come from the fliers no blame be to you sir for all was lost but that the heavens fought the king himself of his wings destitute the army broken and but the backs of britons seen all flying through a straight lane the enemy fullhearted lolling the tongue with slaughtering having work more plentiful than tools to dot struck down some mortally some slightly touchd some falling merely through fear that the straight pass was dammd with dead men hurt behind and cowards living to die with lengthend shame nay do not wonder at it you are made rather to wonder at the things you hear than to work any will you rhyme upont and vent it for a mockery here is one two boys an old man twice a boy a lane preserved the britons was the romans bane lack to what end who dares not stand his foe ill be his friend for if hell do as he is made to do i know hell quickly fly my friendship too you have put me into rhyme still going   this is a lord o noble misery to be i the field and ask what news of me today how many would have given their honours to have saved their carcasses took heel to dot and yet died too i in mine own woe charmd could not find death where i did hear him groan nor feel him where he struck being an ugly monster tis strange he hides him in fresh cups soft beds sweet words or hath more ministers than we that draw his knives i the war well i will find him for being now a favourer to the briton no more a briton i have resumed again the part i came in fight i will no more but yield me to the veriest hind that shall once touch my shoulder great the slaughter is here made by the roman great the answer be britons must take for me my ransoms death on either side i come to spend my breath which neither here ill keep nor bear again but end it by some means for imogen overroasted rather ready long ago so

refined traveller of spain a man in all the worlds new fashion planted that hath a mint of phrases in his brain one whom the music of his own vain tongue doth ravish like enchanting harmony a man of complements whom right and wrong have chose as umpire of their mutiny this child of fancy that armado hight for interim to our studies shall relate in highborn words the worth of many a knight from tawny spain lost in the worlds debate how you delight my lords i know not i but i protest i love to hear him lie and i will use him for my minstrelsy a letter from the magnificent armado will you hear this letter with attention reads  great deputy the welkins vicegerent and sole dominator of navarre my souls earths god and bodys fostering patron reads  so it is peace no words reads  so it is besieged with sablecoloured melancholy i did commend the blackoppressing humour to the most wholesome physic of thy healthgiving air and as i am a gentleman betook myself to walk the time when about

ycleped thy park then for the place where where i mean i did encounter that obscene and preposterous event that draweth from my snowwhite pen the eboncoloured ink which here thou viewest beholdest surveyest or seest but to the place where it standeth northnortheast and by east from the west corner of thy curious knotted garden there did i see that lowspirited swain that base minnow of thy mirth

intimate the payment of a hundred thousand crowns being but the one half of an entire sum disbursed by my father in his wars but say that he or we as neither have received that sum yet there remains unpaid a hundred thousand more in surety of the which one part of aquitaine is bound to us although not valued to the moneys worth if then the king your father will restore but that one half which is unsatisfied we will give up our right in aquitaine and hold fair friendship with his majesty but that it seems he little purposeth for here he doth demand to have repaid a hundred thousand crowns and not demands on payment of a hundred thousand crowns to have his title live in aquitaine which we much rather had depart withal and have the money by our father lent than aquitaine so gelded as it is dear princess were not his requests so far from reasons yielding your fair self should make a yielding gainst some reason in my breast and go well satisfied to france again i do protest i never heard of it and if you prove it ill repay it back or yield up aquitaine satisfy me so it shall suffice me at which interview all liberal reason i will yield unto meantime receive such welcome at my hand as

triumphing in my woe do but behold the tears that swell in me and they thy glory through my grief will show but do not love thyself then thou wilt keep my tears for glasses and still make me weep o

can but say their protestation over so much dear liege i have already sworn that is to live and study here three years but there are other strict observances as not to see a woman in that term which i hope well is not enrolled there and one day in a week to touch no food and but one meal on every day beside the which i hope is not enrolled there and then to sleep but three hours in the night and not be seen to wink of all the day when i was wont to think no harm all night and make a dark night too of half the day which i hope well is not enrolled there o these are barren tasks too hard to keep not to see ladies study fast not sleep let me say no my liege an if you please i only swore to study with your grace and stay here in your court for three years space by yea and nay sir then i swore in jest what is the end of study let me know things hid and barrd you mean from common sense come on then i will swear to study so to know the thing i am forbid to know as thusto study where i well may dine when i to feast expressly am forbid or study where to meet some mistress fine when mistresses from common sense are hid or having sworn too hard a keeping oath study to break it and not break my troth if studys gain be thus and this be so study knows that which yet it doth not know swear me to this and i will neer say no why all delights are vain but that most vain which with pain purchased doth inherit pain as painfully to pore upon a book to seek the light of truth while truth the while doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look light seeking light doth light of light beguile so ere you find where light in darkness lies your light grows dark by losing of your eyes study me how to please the eye indeed by fixing it upon a fairer eye who dazzling so that eye shall be his heed and give him light that it was blinded by study is like the heavens glorious sun that will not be deepsearchd with saucy looks small have continual plodders ever won save base authority from others books these earthly godfathers of heavens lights that give a name to every fixed star have no more profit of their shining nights than those that walk and wot not what they are too much to know is to know nought but fame and every godfather can give a name the spring is near when green geese are abreeding fit in his place and time something then in rhyme well say i am why should proud summer boast before the birds have any cause to sing why should i joy in any abortive birth at christmas i no more desire a rose than wish a snow in mays newfangled mirth but like of each thing that in season grows so you to study now it is too late climb oer the house to unlock the little gate no my good lord i have sworn to stay with you and though i have for barbarism spoke more than for that

yourself must break for well you know here comes in embassy the french kings daughter with yourself to speak a maid of grace and complete majesty about surrender up of aquitaine to her decrepit sick and bedrid father therefore this article is made in vain or vainly comes the admired princess hither so study evermore is overshot while it doth study to have what it would it doth forget to do the thing it should and when it hath the thing it hunteth most tis won as towns with fire so won so lost necessity will make us all forsworn three thousand times within this three years space for every man with his affects is born not by might masterd but by special grace if i break faith this word shall speak for me i am forsworn on mere necessity so to the laws at large i write my name   and he that breaks them in the least degree stands in attainder of eternal shame suggestions are to other as to me but i believe although i seem so loath i am the last that will last keep his oath but is

gone sweet lords sweet lovers o let us embrace as true we are as flesh and blood can be the sea will ebb and flow heaven show his face young blood doth not obey an old decree we cannot cross the cause why we were born therefore of all hands must we be forsworn did they quoth you who sees the heavenly rosaline that like a rude and savage man of inde at the first opening of the gorgeous east bows not his vassal head and strucken blind kisses the base ground with obedient breast what peremptory eaglesighted eye dares look upon the heaven of her brow that is not blinded by her majesty my eyes are then no eyes nor i biron o but for my love day would turn to night of all complexions the culld sovereignty do meet as at a fair in her fair cheek where several worthies make one dignity where nothing wants that want itself doth seek lend me the flourish of all gentle tongues fie painted rhetoric o she needs it not to things of sale a sellers praise belongs she passes praise then praise too short doth blot a witherd hermit fivescore winters worn might shake off fifty looking in her eye beauty doth varnish age as if newborn and gives the crutch the cradles infancy o tis the sun that maketh all things shine is ebony like her o wood divine a wife of such wood were felicity o who can give an oath where is a book that i may swear beauty doth beauty lack if that she learn not of her eye to look no face is fair that is not full so black devils soonest tempt resembling spirits of light o if in black my ladys brows be deckd it mourns that painting and usurping hair should ravish doters with a false aspect and therefore is she born to make black fair her favour turns the fashion of the days for native blood is counted painting now and therefore red that would avoid dispraise paints itself black to imitate her brow your mistresses dare never come in rain for fear their colours should be washd away ill prove her fair or talk till doomsday here o if the streets were paved with thine eyes her feet were much too dainty for such tread nothing so sure and thereby all forsworn tis more than need have at you then affections men at arms consider what you first did swear unto to fast to study and to see no woman flat treason gainst the kingly state of youth say can you fast your stomachs are too young and abstinence engenders maladies and where that you have vowd to study lords in that each of you have forsworn his book can you still dream and pore and thereon look for when would you my lord or you or you have found the ground of studys excellence without the beauty of a womans face   why universal plodding poisons up the nimble spirits in the arteries as motion and longduring action tires the sinewy vigour of the traveller now for not looking on a womans face you have in that forsworn the use of eyes and study too the causer of your vow for where is any author in the world teaches such beauty as a womans eye learning is but an adjunct to ourself and where we are our learning likewise is then when ourselves we see in ladies eyes do we not likewise see our learning there o we have made a vow to study lords and in that vow we have forsworn our books for when would you my liege or you or you in leaden contemplation have found out such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes of beautys tutors have enrichd you with other slow arts entirely keep the brain and therefore finding barren practisers scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil but love first learned in a ladys eyes lives not alone immured in the brain but with the motion of all elements courses as swift as thought in every power and gives to every power a double power above their functions and their offices it adds a precious seeing to the eye a lovers eyes will gaze an eagle blind a lovers ear will hear the lowest sound when the suspicious head of theft is stoppd loves feeling is more soft and sensible than are the tender horns of cockld snails loves tongue proves dainty bacchus gross in taste for valour is not love ,Comedy,4
Measure for Measure,escalus of government the properties to unfold would seem in me to affect speech and discourse since i am put to know that your own science exceeds in that the lists of all advice my strength can give you then no more remains but that to your sufficiency as your worth is able and let them work the nature of our people our citys institutions and the terms for common justice youre as pregnant in as art and practise hath enriched any that we remember there is our commission from which we would not have you warp call hither i say bid come before us angelo   what figure of us think you he will bear for you must know we have with special soul elected him our absence to supply lent him our terror dressd him with our love and given his deputation all the organs of our own power what think you of it look where he comes no more evasion we have with a leavend and prepared choice proceeded to you therefore take your honours our haste from hence is of so quick condition that it prefers itself and leaves unquestiond matters of needful value we shall write to you as time and our concernings shall importune how it goes with us and do look to know what doth befall you here so fare you well to the hopeful execution do i leave you of your commissions my haste may not admit it nor need you on mine honour have to do with any scruple your scope is as mine own so to enforce or qualify the laws as to your soul seems good give me your hand ill privily away i love the people but do not like to stage me to their eyes through it do well i do not relish well their loud applause and aves vehement nor do i think the man of safe discretion that does affect it once more fare you well my holy sir none better knows than you how i have ever loved the life removed and held in idle price to haunt assemblies where youth and cost and witless bravery keeps i have deliverd to lord angelo a man of stricture and firm abstinence my absolute power and place here in vienna and he supposes me travelld to poland for so i have strewd it in the common ear and so it is received now pious sir you will demand of me why i do this hail to you provost so i think you are bound by my charity and my blest order i come to visit the afflicted spirits here in the prison do me the common right to let me see them and to make me know the nature of their crimes that i may minister to them accordingly repent you fair one of the sin you carry ill teach you how you shall arraign your conscience and try your penitence if it be sound or hollowly put on so then it seems your most offenceful act was mutually committed then was your sin of heavier kind than his tis meet so daughter but lest you do repent as that the sin hath brought you to this shame which sorrow is always towards ourselves not heaven showing we would not spare heaven as we love it but as we stand in fear so then you hope of pardon from lord angelo be absolute for death either death or life shall thereby be the sweeter reason thus with life if i do lose thee i do lose a thing that none but fools would keep a breath thou art servile to all the skyey influences that dost this habitation where thou keepst hourly afflict merely thou art deaths fool for him thou labourst by thy flight to shun and yet runnst toward him still thou art not noble for all the accommodations that thou bearst are nursed by baseness thourt by no means valiant for thou dost fear the soft and tender fork of a poor worm thy best of rest is sleep and that thou oft provokest yet grossly fearst thy death which is no more thou art not thyself for thou existst on many a thousand grains that issue out of dust happy thou art not for what thou hast not still thou strivest to get and what thou hast forgetst thou art not certain for thy complexion shifts to strange effects after the moon if thou art rich thourt poor for like an ass whose back with ingots bows thou bears thy heavy riches but a journey and death unloads thee friend hast thou none for thine own bowels which do call thee sire the mere effusion of thy proper loins do curse the gout serpigo and the rheum for ending thee no sooner thou hast nor youth nor age but as it were an afterdinners sleep dreaming on both for all thy blessed youth becomes as aged and doth beg the alms of palsied eld and when thou art old and rich thou hast neither heat affection limb nor beauty to make thy riches pleasant whats yet in this that bears the name of life yet in this life lie hid moe thousand deaths yet death we fear that makes these odds all even dear sir ere long ill visit you again provost a word with you hold you there farewell   provost a word with you that now you are come you will be gone leave me awhile with the maid my mind promises with my habit no loss shall touch her by my company that shall not be much amiss yet as the matter now stands he will avoid your accusation he made trial of you only therefore fasten your ear on my advisings to the love i have in doing good a remedy presents itself i do make myself believe that you may most uprighteously do a poor wronged lady a merited benefit redeem your brother from the angry law do no stain to your own gracious person and much please the absent duke if peradventure he shall ever return to have hearing of this business virtue is bold and goodness never fearful have you not heard speak of mariana the sister of frederick the great soldier who miscarried at sea she should this angelo have married was affianced to her by oath and the nuptial appointed between which time of the contract and limit of the solemnity her brother frederick was wrecked at sea having in that perished vessel the dowry of his sister but mark how heavily this befell to the poor gentlewoman there she lost a noble and renowned brother in his love toward her ever most kind and natural with him the portion and sinew of her fortune her marriagedowry with both her combinate husband this wellseeming angelo left her in her tears and dried not one of them with his comfort swallowed his vows whole pretending in her discoveries of dishonour in few bestowed her on her own lamentation which she yet wears for his sake and he a marble to her tears is washed with them but relents not it is a rupture that you may easily heal and the cure of it not only saves your brother but keeps you from dishonour in doing it this forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance of her first affection his unjust unkindness that in all reason should have quenched her love hath like an impediment in the current made it more violent and unruly go you to angelo answer his requiring with a plausible obedience agree with his demands to the point only refer yourself to this advantage first that your stay with him may not be long that the time may have all shadow and silence in it and the place answer to convenience this being granted in courseand now follows allwe shall advise this wronged maid to stead up your appointment go in your place if the encounter acknowledge itself hereafter it may compel him to her recompense and here by this is your brother saved your honour untainted the poor mariana advantaged and the corrupt deputy scaled the maid will i frame and make fit for his attempt if you think well to carry this as you may the doubleness of the benefit defends the deceit from reproof what think you of it it lies much in your holding up haste you speedily to angelo if for this night he entreat you to his bed give him promise of satisfaction i will presently to saint lukes there at the moated grange resides this dejected mariana at that place call upon me and dispatch with angelo that it may be quickly o heavens what stuff is here and you good brother father what offence hath this man made you sir that we were all as some would seem to be from our faults as faults from seeming free still thus and thus still worse and you i know not where but wheresoever i wish him well he does well in t it is too general a vice and severity must cure it you are pleasant sir and speak apace i never heard the absent duke much detected for women he was not inclined that way tis not possible you do him wrong surely what i prithee might be the cause either this is the envy in you folly or mistaking the very stream of his life and the business he hath helmed must upon a warranted need give him a better proclamation let him be but testimonied in his own bringingsforth and he shall appear to the envious a scholar a statesman and a soldier therefore you speak unskilfully or if your knowledge be more it is much darkened in your malice love talks with better knowledge and knowledge with dearer love i can hardly believe that since you know not what you speak but if ever the duke return as our prayers are he may let me desire you to make your answer before him if it be honest you have spoke you have courage to maintain it i am bound to call upon you and i pray you your name he shall know you better sir if i may live to report you why should he die sir no might nor greatness in mortality can censure scape backwounding calumny the whitest virtue strikes what king so strong can tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue but who comes here bliss and goodness on you none but that there is so great a fever on goodness that the dissolution of it must cure it novelty is only in request and it is as dangerous to be aged in any kind of course as it is virtuous to be constant in any undertaking there is scarce truth enough alive to make societies secure but security enough to make fellowships accurst much upon this riddle runs the wisdom of the world this news is old enough yet it is every days news i pray you sir of what disposition was the duke what pleasure was he given to if his own life answer the straitness of his proceeding it shall become him well wherein if he chance to fail he hath sentenced himself peace be with you   he who the sword of heaven will bear should be as holy as severe pattern in himself to know grace to stand and virtue go more nor less to others paying than by selfoffences weighing shame to him whose cruel striking kills for faults of his own liking twice treble shame on angelo to weed my vice and let his grow o what may man within him hide though angel on the outward side how may likeness made in crimes making practise on the times to draw with idle spiders strings most ponderous and substantial things craft against vice i must apply with angelo tonight shall lie his old betrothed but despised so disguise shall by the disguised pay with falsehood false exacting and perform an old contracting tis good though music oft hath such a charm to make bad good and good provoke to harm i pray you tell me hath any body inquired for me here today much upon this time have i promised here to meet very well met and well come what is the news from this good deputy tis well borne up i have not yet made known to mariana a word of this what ho within come forth   i pray you be acquainted with this maid she comes to do you good take then this your companion by the hand who hath a story ready for your ear i shall attend your leisure but make haste the vaporous night approaches nor gentle daughter fear you not at all he is your husband on a precontract to bring you thus together tis no sin sith that the justice of your title to him doth flourish the deceit come let us go our corns to reap for yet our tithes to sow the best and wholesomest spirts of the night envelope you good provost who calld here of late not isabel theres some in hope and here comes claudios pardon what is that barnardine who is to be executed in the afternoon how came it that the absent duke had not either delivered him to his liberty or executed him i have heard it was ever his manner to do so it is now apparent hath he born himself penitently in prison how seems he to be touched he wants advice more of him anon there is written in your brow provost honesty and constancy if i read it not truly my ancient skill beguiles me but in the boldness of my cunning i will lay myself in hazard claudio whom here you have warrant to execute is no greater forfeit to the law than angelo who hath sentenced him to make you understand this in a manifested effect i crave but four days respite for the which you are to do me both a present and a dangerous courtesy by the vow of mine order i warrant you if my instructions may be your guide let this barnardine be this morning executed and his head born to angelo o deaths a great disguiser and you may add to it shave the head and tie the beard and say it was the desire of the penitent to be so bared before his death you know the course is common if any thing fall to you upon this more than thanks and good fortune by the saint whom i profess i will plead against it with my life were you sworn to the duke or to the deputy you will think you have made no offence if the duke avouch the justice of your dealing not a resemblance but a certainty yet since i see you fearful that neither my coat integrity nor persuasion can with ease attempt you i will go further than i meant to pluck all fears out of you look you sir here is the hand and seal of the duke you know the character i doubt not and the signet is not strange to you o sir you must and therefore i beseech you look forward on the journey you shall go but hear you unfit to live or die o gravel heart after him fellows bring him to the block a creature unprepared unmeet for death and to transport him in the mind he is were damnable o tis an accident that heaven provides dispatch it presently the hour draws on prefixd by angelo see this be done and sent according to command whiles i persuade this rude wretch willingly to die let this be done put them in secret holds both barnardine and claudio ere twice the sun hath made his journal greeting to the under generation you shall find your safety manifested quick dispatch and send the head to angelo   now will i write letters to angelo the provost he shall bear them whose contents shall witness to him i am near at home and that by great injunctions i am bound to enter publicly him ill desire to meet me at the consecrated fount a league below the city and from thence by cold gradation and wellbalanced form we shall proceed with angelo convenient is it make a swift return for i would commune with you of such things that want no ear but yours the tongue of isabel shes come to know if yet her brothers pardon be come hither but i will keep her ignorant of her good to make her heavenly comforts of despair when it is least expected he hath released him isabel from the world his head is off and sent to angelo it is no other show your wisdom daughter in your close patience you shall not be admitted to his sight this letter then to friar peter give tis that he sent me of the dukes return say by this token i desire his company at marianas house tonight her cause and yours ill perfect him withal and he shall bring you before the duke and to the head of angelo accuse him home and home for my poor self i am combined by a sacred vow and shall be absent wend you with this letter command these fretting waters from your eyes with a light heart trust not my holy order if i pervert your course whos here not within sir well youll answer this one day fare ye well you have told me too many of him already sir if they be true if not true none were enough did you such a thing sir your company is fairer than honest rest you well these letters at fit time deliver me   the

fairly met our old and faithful friend we are glad to see you many and hearty thankings to you both we have made inquiry of you and we hear such goodness of your justice that our soul cannot but yield you forth to public thanks forerunning more requital o your desert speaks loud and i should wrong it to lock it in the wards of covert bosom when it deserves with characters of brass a forted residence gainst the tooth of time and razure of oblivion give me your hand and let the subject see to make them know that outward courtesies would fain proclaim favours that keep within come escalus you must walk by us on our other hand and good supporters are you relate your wrongs in what by whom be brief here is lord angelo shall give you justice reveal yourself to him away with her poor soul she speaks this in the infirmity of sense by mine honesty if she be madas i believe no other her madness hath the oddest frame of sense such a dependency of thing on thing as eer i heard in madness many that are not mad have sure more lack of reason what would you say it may be right but you are i the wrong to speak before your time proceed this is most likely by heaven fond wretch thou knowist

events with a prayer they may prove prosperous and let me desire to know how you find claudio prepared i am made to understand that you have lent him visitation you have paid the heavens your function and the prisoner the very debt of your calling i have laboured for the poor gentleman to the extremest shore of my modesty but my brother justice have i found so severe that he hath forced me to tell him he is indeed justice i am going to visit the prisoner fare you well every letter he hath writ hath disvouched other i guess not he shows his reason for that to have a dispatch of complaints and to

prisoners life may in the sworn twelve have a thief or two guiltier than him they try whats open made to justice that justice seizes what know the laws that thieves do pass on thieves tis very pregnant the jewel that we find we stoop and taket because we see it but what we do not see we tread upon and never think of it you may not so extenuate his offence for i have had such faults but

The Merchant of Venice,in sooth i know not why i am so sad it wearies me you say it wearies you but how i caught it found it or came by it what stuff tis made of whereof it is born i am to learn and such a wantwit sadness makes of me that i have much ado to know myself believe me no i thank my fortune for it my ventures are not in one bottom trusted nor to one place nor is my whole estate upon the fortune of this present year therefore my merchandise makes me not sad fie fie your worth is very dear in my regard i take it your own business calls on you and you embrace the occasion to depart i hold the world but as the world gratiano a stage where every man must play a part and mine a sad one farewell ill grow a talker for this gear is that any thing now well tell me now what lady is the same to whom you swore a secret pilgrimage that you today promised to tell me of i pray you good bassanio let me know it and if it stand as you yourself still do within the eye of honour be assured my purse my person my extremest means lie all unlockd to your occasions you know me well and herein spend but time to wind about my love with circumstance and out of doubt you do me now more wrong in making question of my uttermost than if you had made waste of all i have then do but say to me what i should do that in your knowledge may by me be done and i am prest unto it therefore speak thou knowst that all my fortunes are at sea neither have i money nor commodity to raise a present sum therefore go forth try what my credit can in venice do that shall be rackd even to the uttermost to furnish thee to belmont to fair portia go presently inquire and so will i where money is and i no question make to have it of my trust or for my sake   scene ii belmont a room in portias house shylock although i neither lend nor borrow by taking nor by giving of excess yet to supply the ripe wants of my friend ill break a custom is he yet possessd how much ye would and for three months i do never use it and what of him did he take interest this was a venture sir that jacob served for a thing not in his power to bring to pass but swayd and fashiond by the hand of heaven was this inserted to make interest good or is your gold and silver ewes and rams mark you this bassanio the devil can cite scripture for his purpose an evil soul producing holy witness is like a villain with a smiling cheek a goodly apple rotten at the heart o what a goodly outside falsehood hath well shylock shall we be beholding to you i am as like to call thee so again to spit on thee again to spurn thee too if thou wilt lend this money lend it not as to thy friends for when did friendship take a breed for barren metal of his friend but lend it rather to thine enemy who if he break thou mayst with better face exact the penalty content i faith ill seal to such a bond and say there is much kindness in the jew why fear not man i will not forfeit it within these two months thats a month before this bond expires i do expect return of thrice three times the value of this bond yes shylock i will seal unto this bond hie thee gentle jew   the hebrew will turn christian he grows kind come on in this there can be no dismay my ships come home a month before the day whos there fie fie gratiano where are all the rest tis nine oclock our friends all stay for you no masque tonight the wind is come about bassanio presently will go aboard i have sent twenty out to seek for you hear me yet good shylock i pray thee hear me speak let him alone ill follow him no more with bootless prayers he seeks my life his reason well i know i oft deliverd from his forfeitures many that have at times made moan to me therefore he hates me the duke cannot deny the course of law for the commodity that strangers have with us in venice if it be denied will much impeach the justice of his state since that the trade and profit of the city consisteth of all nations therefore go these griefs and losses have so bated me that i shall hardly spare a pound of flesh tomorrow to my bloody creditor well gaoler on pray god bassanio come to see me pay his debt and then i care not ready so please your grace i have heard your grace hath taen great pains to qualify his rigorous course but since he stands obdurate and that no lawful means can carry me out of his envys reach i do oppose my patience to his fury and am armd to suffer with a quietness of spirit the very tyranny and rage of his i pray you think you question with the jew you may as well go stand upon the beach and bid the main flood bate his usual height you may as well use question with the wolf why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb you may as well forbid the mountain pines to wag their high tops and to make no noise when they are fretten with the gusts of heaven you may as well do anything most hard as seek to soften thatthan which whats harder his jewish heart therefore i do beseech you make no more offers use no farther means but with all brief and plain conveniency let me have judgment and the jew his will i am a tainted wether of the flock meetest for death the weakest kind of fruit drops earliest to the ground and so let me you cannot better be employd bassanio than to live still and write mine epitaph ay so he says i do most heartily i do beseech the court to give the judgment but little i am armd and well prepared give me your hand bassanio fare you well grieve not that i am fallen to this for you for herein fortune shows herself more kind than is her custom it is still her use to let the wretched man outlive his wealth to view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow an age of poverty from which lingering penance of such misery doth she cut me off commend me to your honourable wife tell her the process of antonios end say how i loved you speak me fair in death and when the tale is told bid her be judge whether bassanio had not once a love repent but you that you shall lose your friend and he repents not that he pays your debt for if the jew do cut but deep enough ill pay it presently with all my heart so please my lord the duke and all the court to quit the fine for one half of his goods i am content so he will let me have the other half in use to render it upon his death unto the gentleman that lately stole his daughter two things provided more that for this favour he presently become a christian the other that he do record a gift here in the court of all he dies possessd unto his son lorenzo and his daughter and stand indebted over and above in love and service to you evermore my lord bassanio let him have the ring let his deservings and my love withal be valued against your wifes commandment no more than i am well acquitted of i am the unhappy subject of these quarrels i once did lend my body for his wealth which but for him that had your husbands ring had quite miscarried i dare be bound again my soul upon the forfeit that your lord will never more break faith advisedly here lord bassanio swear to keep this ring i am dumb sweet lady you have given me life and living for here i read for certain that my ships are safely come to roadyour mind is tossing on the ocean there where your argosies with portly sail like signiors and rich burghers on the flood or as it were the pageants of the sea do overpeer the petty traffickers that curtsy to them do them reverence as they fly by them with their woven wings my wind cooling my broth would blow me to an ague when i thought what harm a wind too great at sea might do i should not see the sandy hourglass run but i should think of shallows and of flats and see my wealthy andrew dockd in sand vailing her hightop lower than her ribs to kiss her burial should i go to church and see the holy edifice of stone and not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks which touching but my gentle vessels side would scatter all her spices on the stream enrobe the roaring waters with my silks and in a word but even now worth this and now worth nothing shall i have the thought to think on this and shall i lack the thought that such a thing bechanced would make me sad but tell not me i know antonio is sad to think upon his merchandise why then you are in love not in love neither then let us say you are sad because you are not merry and twere as easy for you to laugh and leap and say you are merry because you are not sad now by twoheaded janus nature hath framed strange fellows in her time some that will evermore peep through their eyes and laugh like parrots at a bagpiper and other of such vinegar aspect that theyll not show their teeth in way of smile though nestor swear the jest be laughable i would have stayd till i had made you merry if worthier friends had not prevented me good morrow my good lords well make our leisures to attend on yours we have not spoke us yet of torchbearers tis good we do so his hour is almost past o ten times faster venus pigeons fly to seal loves bonds newmade than they are wont to keep obliged faith unforfeited here comes lorenzo more of this hereafter why man i saw bassanio under sail with him is gratiano gone along and in their ship i am sure lorenzo is not he came too late the ship was under sail but there the duke was given to understand that in a gondola were seen together lorenzo and his amorous jessica besides antonio certified the duke they were not with bassanio in his ship why all the boys in venice follow him crying his stones his daughter and his ducats marry well rememberd i reasond with a frenchman yesterday who told me in the narrow seas that part the french and english there miscarried a vessel of our country richly fraught i thought upon antonio when he told me and wishd in silence that it were not his a kinder gentleman treads not the earth i saw bassanio and antonio part bassanio told him he would make some speed of his return he answerd do not so slubber not business for my sake bassanio but stay the very riping of the time and for the jews bond which he hath of me let it not enter in your mind of love be merry and employ your chiefest thoughts to courtship and such fair ostents of love as shall conveniently become you there and even there his eye being big with tears turning his face he put his hand behind him and with affection wondrous sensible he wrung bassanios hand and so they parted do we so why yet it lives there uncheckd that antonio hath a ship of rich lading wrecked on the narrow seas the goodwins i think they call the place a very dangerous flat and fatal where the carcasses of many a tall ship lie buried as they say if my gossip report be an honest woman of her word come the full stop i would it might prove the end of his losses thats certain i for my part knew the tailor that made the wings she flew withal there is more difference between thy flesh and hers than between jet and ivory more between your bloods than there is between red wine and rhenish but tell us do you hear whether antonio have had any loss at sea or no why i am sure if he forfeit thou wilt not take his flesh whats that good for we have been up and down to seek him it is the most impenetrable cur that ever kept with men i am sure the duke will never grant this forfeiture to holdbelieve me sir had i such venture forth the better part of my affections would be with my hopes abroad i should be still plucking the grass to know where sits the wind peering in maps for ports and piers and roads and every object that might make me fear misfortune to my ventures out of doubt would make me sad here comes bassanio your most noble kinsman gratiano and lorenzo fare ye well we leave you now with better company tis vile unless it may be quaintly orderd and better in my mind not undertook ay marry ill be gone about it straight and so will i the villain jew with outcries raised the duke who went with him to search bassanios ship i never heard a passion so confused so strange outrageous and so variable as the dog jew did utter in the streets my daughter o my ducats o my daughter fled with a christian o my christian ducats justice the law my ducats and my daughter a sealed bag two sealed bags of ducats of double ducats stolen from me by my daughter and jewels two stones two rich and precious stones stolen by my daughter justice find the girl she hath the stones upon her and the ducats let good antonio look he keep his day or he shall pay for this you were best to tell antonio what you hear yet do not suddenly for it may grieve him i think he only loves the world for him i pray thee let us go and find him out and quicken his embraced heaviness with some delight or other now what news on the rialto i would she were as lying a gossip in that as ever knapped ginger or made her neighbours believe she wept for the death of a third husband but it is true without any slips of prolixity or crossing the plain highway of talk that the good antonio the honest antonioo that i had a title good enough to keep his name company ha what sayest thou why the end is he hath lost a ship let me say amen betimes lest the devil cross my prayer for here he comes in the likeness of a jew   how now shylock what news among the merchants and shylock for his own part knew the bird was fledged and then it is the complexion of them all to leave the dam thats certain if the devil may be her judge out upon it old carrion rebels it at these years here comes another of the tribe a third cannot be matched unless the devil himself turn jewgood signiors both when shall we laugh say when you grow exceeding strange must it be so i will not fail you gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing more than any man in all venice his reasons are as two grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff you shall seek all day ere you find them and when you have them they are not worth the search tis not unknown to you antonio how much i have disabled mine estate by something showing a more swelling port than my faint means would grant continuance nor do i now make moan to be abridged from such a noble rate but my chief care is to come fairly off from the great debts wherein my time something too prodigal hath left me gaged to you antonio i owe the most in money and in love and from your love i have a warranty to unburden all my plots and purposes how to get clear of all the debts i owe in my schooldays when i had lost one shaft i shot his fellow of the selfsame flight the selfsame way with more advised watch to find the other forth and by adventuring both i oft found both i urge this childhood proof because what follows is pure innocence i owe you much and like a wilful youth that which i owe is lost but if you please to shoot another arrow that self way which you did shoot the first i do not doubt as i will watch the aim or to find both or bring your latter hazard back again and thankfully rest debtor for the first in belmont is a lady richly left and she is fair and fairer than that word of wondrous virtues sometimes from her eyes i did receive fair speechless messages her name is portia nothing undervalued to catos daughter brutus portia nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth for the four winds blow in from every coast renowned suitors and her sunny locks hang on her temples like a golden fleece which makes her seat of belmont colchos strand and many jasons come in quest of her o my antonio had i but the means to hold a rival place with one of them i have a mind presages me such thrift that i should questionless be fortunate ay sir for three months for the which as i told you antonio shall be bound may you stead me will you pleasure me shall i know your answer your answer to that have you heard any imputation to the contrary be assured you may if it please you to dine with us this is signior antonio shylock do you hear this were kindness you shall not seal to such a bond for me ill rather dwell in my necessity i like not fair terms and a villains mind you may do so but let it be so hasted that supper be ready at the farthest by five of the clock see these letters delivered put the liveries to making and desire gratiano to come anon to my lodging gramercy wouldst thou aught with me one speak for both what would you i know thee well thou hast obtaind thy suit shylock thy master spoke with me this day and hath preferrd thee if it be preferment to leave a rich jews service to become the follower of so poor a gentleman thou speakst it well go father with thy son take leave of thy old master and inquire my lodging out give him a livery more guarded than his fellows see it done i pray thee good leonardo think on this these things being bought and orderly bestowd return in haste for i do feast tonight my bestesteemd acquaintance hie thee go gratiano you have obtaind it why then you must but hear thee gratiano thou art too wild too rude and bold of voice parts that become thee happily enough and in such eyes as ours appear not faults but where thou art not known why there they show something too liberal pray thee take pain to allay with some cold drops of modesty thy skipping spirit lest through thy wild behavior i be misconstrued in the place i go to and lose my hopes well we shall see your bearing no that were pity i would entreat you rather to put on your boldest suit of mirth for we have friends that purpose merriment but fare you well i have some business let me choose for as i am i live upon the rack none but that ugly treason of mistrust which makes me fear the enjoying of my love there may as well be amity and life tween snow and fire as treason and my love promise me life and ill confess the truth confess and love had been the very sum of my confession o happy torment when my torturer doth teach me answers for deliverance but let me to my fortune and the caskets so may the outward shows be least themselves the world is still deceived with ornament in law what plea so tainted and corrupt but being seasoned with a gracious voice obscures the show of evil in religion what damned error but some sober brow will bless it and approve it with a text hiding the grossness with fair ornament there is no vice so simple but assumes some mark of virtue on his outward parts how many cowards whose hearts are all as false as stairs of sand wear yet upon their chins the beards of hercules and frowning mars who inward searchd have livers white as milk and these assume but valours excrement to render them redoubted look on beauty and you shall see tis purchased by the weight which therein works a miracle in nature making them lightest that wear most of it so are those crisped snaky golden locks which make such wanton gambols with the wind upon supposed fairness often known to be the dowry of a second head the skull that bred them in the sepulchre thus ornament is but the guiled shore to a most dangerous sea the beauteous scarf veiling an indian beauty in a word the seeming truth which cunning times put on to entrap the wisest therefore thou gaudy gold hard food for midas i will none of thee nor none of thee thou pale and common drudge tween man and man but thou thou meagre lead which rather threatenest than dost promise aught thy paleness moves me more than eloquence and here choose i joy be the consequence what find i here   fair portias counterfeit what demigod hath come so near creation move these eyes or whether riding on the balls of mine seem they in motion here are severd lips parted with sugar breath so sweet a bar should sunder such sweet friends here in her hairs the painter plays the spider and hath woven a golden mesh to entrap the hearts of men faster than gnats in cobwebs but her eyes how could he see to do them having made one methinks it should have power to steal both his and leave itself unfurnishd yet look how far the substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow in underprizing it so far this shadow doth limp behind the substance heres the scroll the continent and summary of my fortune   you that choose not by the view chance as fair and choose as true since this fortune falls to you be content and seek no new if you be well pleased with this and hold your fortune for your bliss turn you where your lady is and claim her with a loving kiss a gentle scroll fair lady by your leave i come by note to give and to receive like one of two contending in a prize that thinks he hath done well in peoples eyes hearing applause and universal shout giddy in spirit still gazing in a doubt whether these pearls of praise be his or no so thrice fair lady stand i even so as doubtful whether what i see be true until confirmd signd ratified by you madam you have bereft me of all words only my blood speaks to you in my veins and there is such confusion in my powers as after some oration fairly spoke by a beloved prince there doth appear among the buzzing pleased multitude where every something being blent together turns to a wild of nothing save of joy expressd and not expressd but when this ring parts from this finger then parts life from hence o then be bold to say bassanios dead with all my heart so thou canst get a wife and do you gratiano mean

mong other things i shall digest it the moon shines bright in such a night as this when the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees and they did make no noise in such a night troilus methinks mounted the troyan walls and sighd his soul toward the grecian tents where cressid lay that night in such a night stood dido with a willow in her hand upon the wild sea banks and waft her love to come again to carthage in such a night did jessica steal from the wealthy jew and with an unthrift love did run from venice as far as belmont in such a night did pretty jessica like a little shrew slander her love

jessica and ceremoniously let us prepare some welcome for the mistress of the house who calls leave hollaing man here here sweet soul lets in and there expect their coming and yet no matter why should we go in my friend stephano signify i pray you within the house your mistress is at hand and bring your music forth into the air   how sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank here will we sit and let the sounds of music creep in our ears soft stillness and the night become the touches of sweet harmony sit jessica look how the floor of heaven is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold theres not the smallest orb which thou beholdst but in his motion like an angel sings still quiring to the youngeyed cherubins such harmony is in immortal souls but whilst this muddy vesture of decay doth grossly close it in we cannot hear it   come ho and wake diana with a hymn with sweetest touches pierce your mistress ear and draw her home with music the reason is your spirits are attentive for do but note a wild and wanton herd or race of youthful and unhandled colts fetching mad bounds bellowing and neighing loud which is the hot condition of their blood if they but hear perchance a trumpet sound or any air of music touch their ears you shall perceive them make a mutual stand their savage eyes turnd to a modest gaze by the sweet power of music therefore the poet did feign that orpheus drew trees stones and floods since nought so stockish hard and full of rage but music for the time doth change his nature the man that hath no music in himself nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds is fit,Comedy,7
A Midsummer Nights Dream,now fair hippolyta our nuptial hour draws on apace four happy days bring in another moon but o methinks how slow this old moon wanes she lingers my desires like to a stepdame or a dowager long withering out a young man revenue go philostrate stir up the athenian youth to merriments awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth turn melancholy forth to funerals the pale companion is not for our pomp   hippolyta i wood thee with my sword and won thy love doing thee injuries but i will wed thee in another key with pomp with triumph and with revelling thanks good egeus whats the news with thee what say you hermia be advised fair maid to you your father should be as a god one that composed your beauties yea and one to whom you are but as a form in wax by him imprinted and within his power to leave the figure or disfigure it demetrius is a worthy gentleman in himself he is but in this kind wanting your fathers voice the other must be held the worthier rather your eyes must with his judgment look either to die the death or to abjure for ever the society of men therefore fair hermia question your desires know of your youth examine well your blood whether if you yield not to your fathers choice you can endure the livery of a nun for aye to be in shady cloister mewd to live a barren sister all your life chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon thriceblessed they that master so their blood to undergo such maiden pilgrimage but earthlier happy is the rose distilld than that which withering on the virgin thorn grows lives and dies in single blessedness take time to pause and by the next new moon the sealingday betwixt my love and me for everlasting bond of fellowship upon that day either prepare to die for disobedience to your fathers will or else to wed demetrius as he would or on dianas altar to protest for aye austerity and single life i must confess that i have heard so much and with demetrius thought to have spoke thereof but being overfull of selfaffairs my mind did lose it but demetrius come and come egeus you shall go with me i have some private schooling for you both for you fair hermia look you arm yourself to fit your fancies to your fathers will or else the law of athens yields you up which by no means we may extenuate to death or to a vow of single life come my hippolyta what cheer my love demetrius and egeus go along i must employ you in some business against our nuptial and confer with you of something nearly that concerns yourselves go one of you find out the forester for now our observation is performd and since we have the vaward of the day my love shall hear the music of my hounds uncouple in the western valley let them go dispatch i say and find the forester   we will fair queen up to the mountains top and mark the musical confusion of hounds and echo in conjunction my hounds are bred out of the spartan kind so flewd so sanded and their heads are hung with ears that sweep away the morning dew crookkneed and dewlappd like thessalian bulls slow in pursuit but matchd in mouth like bells each under each a cry more tuneable was never hollad to nor cheerd with horn in crete in sparta nor in thessaly judge when you hear but soft what nymphs are these no doubt they rose up early to observe the rite of may and hearing our intent came here in grace our solemnity but speak egeus is not this the day that hermia should give answer of her choice go bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns   good morrow friends saint valentine is past begin these woodbirds but to couple now i pray you all stand up i know you two are rival enemies how comes this gentle concord in the world that hatred is so far from jealousy to sleep by hate and fear no enmity fair lovers you are fortunately met of this discourse we more will hear anon egeus i will overbear your will for in the temple by and by with us these couples shall eternally be knit and for the morning now is something worn our purposed hunting shall be set aside away with us to athens three and three well hold a feast in great solemnity come hippolyta more strange than true i never may believe these antique fables nor these fairy toys lovers and madmen have such seething brains such shaping fantasies that apprehend more than cool reason ever comprehends the lunatic the lover and the poet are of imagination all compact one sees more devils than vast hell can hold that is the madman the lover all as frantic sees helens beauty in a brow of egypt the poets eye in fine frenzy rolling doth glance from heaven to earth from earth to heaven and as imagination bodies forth the forms of things unknown the poets pen turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing a local habitation and a name such tricks hath strong imagination that if it would but apprehend some joy it comprehends some bringer of that joy or in the night imagining some fear how easy is a bush supposed a bear here come the lovers full of joy and mirth   joy gentle friends joy and fresh days of love accompany your hearts come now what masques what dances shall we have to wear away this long age of three hours between our aftersupper and bedtime where is our usual manager of mirth what revels are in hand is there no play to ease the anguish of a torturing hour call philostrate say what abridgement have you for this evening what masque what music how shall we beguile the lazy time if not with some delight reads  the battle with the centaurs to be sung by an athenian eunuch to the harp well none of that that have i told my love in glory of my kinsman hercules   the riot of the tipsy bacchanals tearing the thracian singer in their rage that is an old device and it was playd when i from thebes came last a conqueror   the thrice three muses mourning for the death of learning late deceased in beggary that is some satire keen and critical not sorting with a nuptial ceremony   a tedious brief scene of young pyramus and his love thisbe very tragical mirth merry and tragical tedious and brief that is hot ice and wondrous strange snow how shall we find the concord of this discord what are they that do play it and we will hear it i will hear that play for never anything can be amiss when simpleness and duty tender it go bring them in and take your places ladies why gentle sweet you shall see no such thing the kinder we to give them thanks for nothing our sport shall be to take what they mistake and what poor duty cannot do noble respect takes it in might not merit where i have come great clerks have purposed to greet me with premeditated welcomes where i have seen them shiver and look pale make periods in the midst of sentences throttle their practised accent in their fears and in conclusion dumbly have broke off not paying me a welcome trust me sweet out of this silence yet i pickd a welcome and in the modesty of fearful duty i read as much as from the rattling tongue of saucy and audacious eloquence love therefore and tonguetied simplicity in least speak most to my capacity let him approach this fellow doth not stand upon points his speech was like a tangled chain nothing impaired but all disordered who is next i wonder if the lion be to speak would you desire lime and hair to speak better pyramus draws near the wall silence the wall methinks being sensible should curse again now is the mural down between the two neighbours the best in this kind are but shadows and the worst are no worse if imagination amend them if we imagine no worse of them than they of themselves they may pass for excellent men here come two noble beasts in a man and a lion a very gentle beast of a good conscience true and a goose for his discretion his discretion i am sure cannot carry his valour for the goose carries not the fox it is well leave it to his discretion and let us listen to the moon he is no crescent and his horns are invisible within the circumference this is the greatest error of all the rest the man should be put into the lanthorn how is it else the man i the moon it appears by his small light of discretion that he is in the wane but yet in courtesy in all reason we must stay the time well run thisbe well moused lion this passion and the death of a dear friend would go near to make a man look sad with the help of a surgeon he might yet recover and prove an ass she will find him by starlight here she comes and her passion ends the play moonshine and lion are left to bury the dead no epilogue i pray you for your play needs no excuse never excuse for when the players are all dead there needs none to be blamed marry if he that writ it had played pyramus and hanged himself in thisbes garter it would have been a fine tragedy and so it is truly and very notably discharged but come your bergomask let your epilogue alone   the iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve lovers to bed tis almost fairy time i fear we shall outsleep the coming morn as much as we this night have overwatchd this palpablegross play hath well beguiled the heavy gait of night sweet friends to bed a fortnight hold we this solemnity in nightly revels and new jollityfour days will quickly steep themselves in night four nights will quickly dream away the time and then the moon like to a silver bow newbent in heaven shall behold the night of our solemnities i was with hercules and cadmus once when in a wood of crete they bayd the bear with hounds of sparta never did i hear such gallant chiding for besides the groves the skies the fountains every region near seemd all one mutual cry i never heard so musical a discord such sweet thunder tis strange my theseus that these lovers speak of but all the story of the night told over and all their minds transfigured so together more witnesseth than fancys images and grows to something of great constancy but howsoever strange and admirable i love not to see wretchedness oer charged and duty in his service perishing he says they can do nothing in this kind indeed he hath played on his prologue like a child on a recorder a sound but not in government this is the silliest stuff that ever i heard it must be your imagination then and not theirs i am aweary of this moon would he would change well shone moon truly the moon shines with a good grace beshrew my heart but i pity the man how chance moonshine is gone before thisbe comes back and finds her lover methinks she should not use a long one for such a pyramus i hope she will be briefhappy be theseus our renowned duke full of vexation come i with complaint against my child my daughter hermia stand forth demetrius my noble lord this man hath my consent to marry her stand forth lysander and my gracious duke this man hath bewitchd the bosom of my child thou thou lysander thou hast given her rhymes and interchanged lovetokens with my child thou hast by moonlight at her window sung with feigning voice verses of feigning love and stolen the impression of her fantasy with bracelets of thy hair rings gawds conceits knacks trifles nosegays sweetmeats messengers of strong prevailment in unhardend youth with cunning hast thou filchd my daughters heart turnd her obedience which is due to me to stubborn harshness and my gracious duke be it so she will not here before your grace consent to marry with demetrius i beg the ancient privilege of athens as she is mine i may dispose of her which shall be either to this gentleman or to her death according to our law immediately provided in that case scornful lysander true he hath my love and what is mine my love shall render him and she is mine and all my right of her i do estate unto demetrius with duty and desire we follow you my lord this is my daughter here asleep and this lysander this demetrius is this helena old nedars helena i wonder of their being here together it is my lord enough enough my lord you have enough i beg the law the law upon his head they would have stolen away they would demetrius thereby to have defeated you and me you of your wife and me of my consent of my consent that she should be your wifeso is lysander i would my father lookd but with my eyes i do entreat your grace to pardon me i know not by what power i am made bold nor how it may concern my modesty in such a presence here to plead my thoughts but i beseech your grace that i may know the worst that may befall me in this case if i refuse to wed demetrius so will i grow so live so die my lord ere i will my virgin patent up unto his lordship whose unwished yoke my soul consents not to give sovereignty belike for want of rain which i could well beteem them from the tempest of my eyes o cross too high to be enthralld to low o spite too old to be engaged to young o hell to choose love by anothers eyes if then true lovers have been ever crossd it stands as an edict in destiny then let us teach our trial patience because it is a customary cross as due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs wishes and tears poor fancys followers my good lysander i swear to thee by cupids strongest bow by his best arrow with the golden head by the simplicity of venus doves by that which knitteth souls and prospers loves and by that fire which burnd the carthage queen when the false troyan under sail was seen by all the vows that ever men have broke in number more than ever women spoke in that same place thou hast appointed me tomorrow truly will i meet with thee god speed fair helena whither away i frown upon him yet he loves me still i give him curses yet he gives me love the more i hate the more he follows me his folly helena is no fault of mine take comfort he no more shall see my face lysander and myself will fly this place before the time i did lysander see seemd athens as a paradise to me o then what graces in my love do dwell that he hath turnd a heaven unto a hell and in the wood where often you and i upon faint primrosebeds were wont to lie emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet there my lysander and myself shall meet and thence from athens turn away our eyes to seek new friends and stranger companies farewell sweet playfellow pray thou for us and good luck grant thee thy demetrius keep word lysander we must starve our sight from lovers food till morrow deep midnight be it so lysander find you out a bed for i upon this bank will rest my head nay good lysander for my sake my dear lie further off yet do not lie so near lysander riddles very prettily now much beshrew my manners and my pride if hermia meant to say lysander lied but gentle friend for love and courtesy lie further off in human modesty such separation as may well be said becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid so far be distant and good night sweet friend thy love neer alter till thy sweet life end with half that wish the wishers eyes be pressd awaking  help me lysander help me do thy best to pluck this crawling serpent from my breast ay me for pity what a dream was here lysander look how i do quake with fear methought a serpent eat my heart away and you sat smiling at his cruel pray lysander what removed lysander lord what out of hearing gone no sound no word alack where are you speak an if you hear speak of all loves i swoon almost with fear no then i well perceive you all not nigh either death or you ill find immediately now i but chide but i should use thee worse for thou i fear hast given me cause to curse if thou hast slain lysander in his sleep being oer shoes in blood plunge in the deep and kill me too the sun was not so true unto the day as he to me would he have stolen away from sleeping hermia ill believe as soon this whole earth may be bored and that the moon may through the centre creep and so displease her brothers noontide with antipodes it cannot be but thou hast murderd him so should a murderer look so dead so grim whats this to my lysander where is he ah good demetrius wilt thou give him me out dog out cur thou drivest me past the bounds of maidens patience hast thou slain him then henceforth be never numberd among men o once tell true tell true even for my sake durst thou have lookd upon him being awake and hast thou killd him sleeping o brave touch could not a worm an adder do so much an adder did it for with doubler tongue than thine thou serpent never adder stung i pray thee tell me then that he is well a privilege never to see me more and from thy hated presence part i so see me no more whether he be dead or no dark night that from the eye his function takes the ear more quick of apprehension makes wherein it doth impair the seeing sense it pays the hearing double recompense thou art not by mine eye lysander found mine ear i thank it brought me to thy sound but why unkindly didst thou leave me so what love could press lysander from my side you speak not as you think it cannot be i am amazed at your passionate words i scorn you not it seems that you scorn me sweet do not scorn her so lysander whereto tends all this why are you grown so rude what change is this sweet love do you not jest what can you do me greater harm than hate hate me wherefore o me what news my love am not i hermia are not you lysander i am as fair now as i was erewhile since night you loved me yet since night you left me why then you left meo the gods forbid in earnest shall i say o me you juggler you cankerblossom you thief of love what have you come by night and stolen my loves heart from him puppet why so ay that way goes the game now i perceive that she hath made compare between our statures she hath urged her height and with her personage her tall personage her height forsooth she hath prevaild with him and are you grown so high in his esteem because i am so dwarfish and so low how low am i thou painted maypole speak how low am i i am not yet so low but that my nails can reach unto thine eyes lower hark again why get you gone who ist that hinders you what with lysander little again nothing but low and little why will you suffer her to flout me thus let me come to her you mistress all this coil is long of you nay go not back i am amazed and know not what to say never so weary never so in woe bedabbled with the dew and torn with briers i can no further crawl no further go my legs can keep no pace with my desires here will i rest me till the break of day heavens shield lysander if they mean a fray methinks i see these things with parted eye when every thing seems double yea and my fatherrelent sweet hermia and lysander yield thy crazed title to my certain right i love thee not therefore pursue me not where is lysander and fair hermia the one ill slay the other slayeth me thou toldst me they were stolen unto this wood and here am i and wode within this wood because i cannot meet my hermia hence get thee gone and follow me no more do i entice you do i speak you fair or rather do i not in plainest truth tell you i do not nor i cannot love you tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit for i am sick when i do look on thee you do impeach your modesty too much to leave the city and commit yourself into the hands of one that loves you not to trust the opportunity of night and the ill counsel of a desert place with the rich worth of your virginity ill run from thee and hide me in the brakes and leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts i will not stay thy questions let me go or if thou follow me do not believe but i shall do thee mischief in the wood i charge thee hence and do not haunt me thus stay on thy peril i alone will go o why rebuke you him that loves you so lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe so should the murderd look and so should i pierced through the heart with your stern cruelty yet you the murderer look as bright as clear as yonder venus in her glimmering sphere i had rather give his carcass to my hounds you spend your passion on a misprised mood i am not guilty of lysanders blood nor is he dead for aught that i can tell an if i could what should i get therefore there is no following her in this fierce vein here therefore for a while i will remain so sorrows heaviness doth heavier grow for debt that bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owe which now in some slight measure it will pay if for his tender here i make some stay awaking  o helena goddess nymph perfect divine to what my love shall i compare thine eyne crystal is muddy o how ripe in show thy lips those kissing cherries tempting grow that pure congealed white high taurus snow fannd with the eastern wind turns to a crow when thou holdst up thy hand o let me kiss this princess of pure white this seal of bliss lysander keep thy hermia i will none if eer i loved her all that love is gone my heart to her but as guestwise sojournd and now to helen is it home returnd there to remain disparage not the faith thou dost not know lest to thy peril thou aby it dear look where thy love comes yonder is thy dear if she cannot entreat i can compel i say i love thee more than he can do quick come no no hell   seem to break loose take on as you would follow but yet come not you are a tame man go i would i had your bond for i perceive a weak bond holds you ill not trust your word no sir she shall not though you take her part you are too officious in her behalf that scorns your services let her alone speak not of helena take not her part for if thou dost intend never so little show of love to her thou shalt aby it follow nay ill go with thee cheek by jole lysander speak again thou runaway thou coward art thou fled speak in some bush where dost thou hide thy head yea art thou there abide me if thou darest for well i wot thou runnst before me shifting every place and darest not stand nor look me in the face where art thou now nay then thou mockst me thou shalt buy this dear if ever i thy face by daylight see now go thy way faintness constraineth me to measure out my length on this cold bed by days approach look to be visited my lord fair helen told me of their stealth of this their purpose hither to this wood and i in fury hither followd them fair helena in fancy following me but my good lord i wot not by what power but by some power it ismy love to hermia melted as the snow seems to me now as the remembrance of an idle gaud which in my childhood i did dote upon and all the faith the virtue of my heart the object and the pleasure of mine eye is only helena to her my lord was i betrothd ere i saw hermia but like in sickness did i loathe this food but as in health come to my natural taste now i do wish it love it long for it and will for evermore be true to it these things seem small and undistinguishable are you sure that we are awake it seems to me that yet we sleep we dream do not you think the duke was here and bid us follow him why then we are awake lets follow him and by the way let us recount our dreams no wonder my lord one lion may when many asses do it is the wittiest partition that ever i heard discourse my lord no remedy my lord when walls are so wilful to hear without warning the very best at a beast my lord that eer i saw not so my lord for his valour cannot carry his discretion and the fox carries the goose he should have worn the horns on his head he dares not come there for the candle for you see it is already in snuff why all these should be in the lanthorn for all these are in the moon but silence here comes thisbe well roared lion and then came pyramus no die but an ace for him for he is but one a mote will turn the balance which pyramus which thisbe is the better he for a man god warrant us she for a woman god bless us and thus she means videlicet ay and wall tooyou have her fathers love demetrius let me have hermias do you marry him i am my lord as well derived as he as well possessd my love is more than his my fortunes every way as fairly rankd if not with vantage as demetrius and which is more than all these boasts can be i am beloved of beauteous hermia why should not i then prosecute my right demetrius ill avouch it to his head made love to nedars daughter helena and won her soul and she sweet lady dotes devoutly dotes dotes in idolatry upon this spotted and inconstant man how now my love why is your cheek so pale how chance the roses there do fade so fast ay me for aught that i could ever read could ever hear by tale or history the course of true love never did run smooth but either it was different in blood or else misgraffed in respect of years or else it stood upon the choice of friends or if there were a sympathy in choice war death or sickness did lay siege to it making it momentany as a sound swift as a shadow short as any dream brief as the lightning in the collied night that in a spleen unfolds both heaven and earth and ere a man hath power to say behold the jaws of darkness do devour it up so quick bright things come to confusion a good persuasion therefore hear me hermia i have a widow aunt a dowager of great revenue and she hath no child from athens is her house remote seven leagues and she respects me as her only son there gentle hermia may i marry thee and to that place the sharp athenian law cannot pursue us if thou lovest me then steal forth thy fathers house tomorrow night and in the wood a league without the town where i did meet thee once with helena to do observance to a morn of may there will i stay for thee keep promise love look here comes helena helen to you our minds we will unfold tomorrow night when phoebe doth behold her silver visage in the watery glass decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass a time that lovers flights doth still conceal through athens gates have we devised to steal i will my hermia   helena adieu as you on him demetrius dote on you fair love you faint with wandering in the wood and to speak troth i have forgot our way well rest us hermia if you think it good and tarry for the comfort of the day one turf shall serve as pillow for us both one heart one bed two bosoms and one troth o take the sense sweet of my innocence love takes the meaning in loves conference i mean that my heart unto yours is knit so that but one heart we can make of it two bosoms interchained with an oath so then two bosoms and a single troth then by your side no bedroom me deny for lying so hermia i do not lie amen amen to that fair prayer say i and then end life when i end loyalty here is my bed sleep give thee all his rest awaking  and run through fire i will for thy sweet sake transparent helena nature shows art that through thy bosom makes me see thy heart where is demetrius o how fit a word is that vile name to perish on my sword content with hermia no i do repent the tedious minutes i with her have spent not hermia but helena i love who will not change a raven for a dove the will of man is by his reason swayd and reason says you are the worthier maid things growing are not ripe until their season so i being young till now ripe not to reason and touching now the point of human skill reason becomes the marshal to my will and leads me to your eyes where i oerlook loves stories written in loves richest book she sees not hermia hermia sleep thou there and never mayst thou come lysander near for as a surfeit of the sweetest things the deepest loathing to the stomach brings or as tie heresies that men do leave are hated most of those they did deceive so thou my surfeit and my heresy of all be hated but the most of me and all my powers address your love and might to honour helen and to be her knight why should you think that i should woo in scorn scorn and derision never come in tears look when i vow i weep and vows so born in their nativity all truth appears how can these things in me seem scorn to you bearing the badge of faith to prove them true i had no judgment when to her i swore demetrius loves her and he loves not you you are unkind demetrius be not so for you love hermia this you know i know and here with all good will with all my heart in hermias love i yield you up my part and yours of helena to me bequeath whom i do love and will do till my death helen it is not so why should he stay whom love doth press to go lysanders love that would not let him bide fair helena who more engilds the night than all you fiery oes and eyes of light why seekst thou me could not this make thee know the hate i bear thee made me leave thee so stay gentle helena hear my excuse my love my life my soul fair helena thou canst compel no more than she entreat thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers helen i love thee by my life i do i swear by that which i will lose for thee to prove him false that says i love thee not if thou say so withdraw and prove it too away you ethiope hang off thou cat thou burr vile thing let loose or i will shake thee from me like a serpent thy love out tawny tartar out out loathed medicine hated potion hence demetrius i will keep my word with thee what should i hurt her strike her kill her dead although i hate her ill not harm her so ay by my life and never did desire to see thee more therefore be out of hope of question of doubt be certain nothing truer tis no jest that i do hate thee and love helena be not afraid she shall not harm thee helena get you gone you dwarf you minimus of hindering knotgrass made you bead you acorn now she holds me not now follow if thou darest to try whose right of thine or mine is most in helena where art thou proud demetrius speak thou now i will be with thee straight he goes before me and still dares me on when i come where he calls then he is gone the villain is much lighterheeld than i i followd fast but faster he did fly that fallen am i in dark uneven way and here will rest me   come thou gentle day for if but once thou show me thy grey light ill find demetrius and revenge this spite pardon my lord my lord i shall reply amazedly half sleep half waking but as yet i swear i cannot truly say how i came here but as i thinkfor truly would i speak and now do i bethink me so it is i came with hermia hither our intent was to be gone from athens where we might without the peril of the athenian law and he did bid us follow to the temple more than to us wait in your royal walks your board your bed he hath rid his prologue like a rough colt he knows not the stop a good moral my lord it is not enough to speak but to speak true this lion is a very fox for his valour proceed moon and so the lion vanished less than an ace man for he is dead he is nothing she hath spied him already with those sweet eyescall you me fair that fair again unsay demetrius loves your fair o happy fair your eyes are lodestars and your tongues sweet air more tuneable than lark to shepherds ear when wheat is green when hawthorn buds appear sickness is catching o were favour so yours would i catch fair hermia ere i go my ear should catch your voice my eye your eye my tongue should catch your tongues sweet melody were the world mine demetrius being bated the rest id give to be to you translated o teach me how you look and with what art you sway the motion of demetrius heart o that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill o that my prayers could such affection move the more i love the more he hateth me none but your beauty would that fault were mine how happy some oer other some can be through athens i am thought as fair as she but what of that demetrius thinks not so he will not know what all but he do know and as he errs doting on hermias eyes so i admiring of his qualities things base and vile folding no quantity love can transpose to form and dignity love looks not with the eyes but with the mind and therefore is wingd cupid painted blind nor hath loves mind of any judgement taste wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste and therefore is love said to be a child because in choice he is so oft beguiled as waggish boys in game themselves forswear so the boy love is perjured every where for ere demetrius lookd on hermias eyne he haild down oaths that he was only mine and when this hail some heat from hermia felt so he dissolved and showers of oaths did melt i will go tell him of fair hermias flight then to the wood will he tomorrow night pursue her and for this intelligence if i have thanks it is a dear expense but herein mean i to enrich my pain to have his sight thither and back again you draw me you hardhearted adamant but yet you draw not iron for my heart is true as steel leave you your power to draw and i shall have no power to follow you and even for that do i love you the more i am your spaniel and demetrius the more you beat me i will fawn on you use me but as your spaniel spurn me strike me neglect me lose me only give me leave unworthy as i am to follow you what worser place can i beg in your love and yet a place of high respect with me than to be used as you use your dog and i am sick when i look not on you your virtue is my privilege for that it is not night when i do see your face therefore i think i am not in the night nor doth this wood lack worlds of company,Comedy,8

her my fortunes his grace hath made the match and an grace say amen to it niece will you look to those things i told you of theres little of the melancholy element in her my lord she is never sad but when she sleeps and not ever sad then for i have heard my daughter say she hath often dreamed of unhappiness and waked herself with laughing o by no means she mocks all her wooers out of suit o lord my lord if they were but a week married they would talk themselves mad not till monday my dear son which is hence a just sevennight and a time too brief too to have all things answer my mind my lord i am for you though it cost me ten nights watchings no nor i neither but most wonderful that she should so dote on signior benedick whom she hath in all outward behaviors seemed ever to abhor by my troth my lord i cannot tell what to think of it but that she loves him with an enraged affection it is past the infinite of thought o god counterfeit there was never counterfeit of passion came so near the life of passion as she discovers it what effects my lord she will sit you you heard my daughter tell you how i would have sworn it had my lord especially against benedick no and swears she never will thats her torment this says she now when she is beginning to write to him for shell be up twenty times a night and there will she sit in her smock till she have writ a sheet of paper my daughter tells us all o when she had writ it and was reading it over she found benedick and beatrice between the sheet o she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence railed at herself that she should be so immodest to write to one that she knew would flout her i measure him says she by my own spirit for i should flout him if he writ to me yea though i love him i should she doth indeed my daughter says so and the ecstasy hath so much overborne her that my daughter is sometime afeared she will do a desperate outrage to herself it is very true o my lord wisdom and blood combating in so tender a body we have ten proofs to one that blood hath the victory i am sorry for her as i have just cause being her uncle and her guardian were it good think you if he do fear god a must necessarily keep peace if he break the peace he ought to enter into a quarrel with fear and trembling nay thats impossible she may wear her heart out first my lord will you walk dinner is ready so say imethinks you are sadder where is but a humour or a worm indeed he looks younger than he did by the loss of a beard what would you with me honest neighbour brief i pray you for you see it is a busy time with me what is it my good friends neighbours you are tedious all thy tediousness on me ah i would fain know what you have to say indeed neighbour he comes too short of you i must leave you take their examination yourself and bring it me i am now in great haste as it may appear unto you drink some wine ere you go fare you well ill wait upon them i am ready come friar francis be brief only to the plain form of marriage and you shall recount their particular duties afterwards to be married to her friar you come to marry her i dare make his answer none as freely son as god did give her me what do you mean my lord dear my lord if you in your own proof have vanquishd the resistance of her youth and made defeat of her virginity sweet prince why speak not you are these things spoken or do i but dream all this is so but what of this my lord i charge thee do so as thou art my child hath no mans dagger here a point for me o fate take not away thy heavy hand death is the fairest cover for her shame that may be wishd for dost thou look up wherefore why doth not every earthly thing cry shame upon her could she here deny the story that is printed in her blood do not live hero do not ope thine eyes for did i think thou wouldst not quickly die thought i thy spirits were stronger than thy shames myself would on the rearward of reproaches strike at thy life grieved i i had but one chid i for that at frugal natures frame o one too much by thee why had i one why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes why had i not with charitable hand took up a beggars issue at my gates who smirchd thus and mired with infamy i might have said no part of it is mine this shame derives itself from unknown loins but mine and mine i loved and mine i praised and mine that i was proud on mine so much that i myself was to myself not mine valuing of herwhy she o she is fallen into a pit of ink that the wide sea hath drops too few to wash her clean again and salt too little which may season give to her foultainted flesh confirmd confirmd o that is stronger made which was before barrd up with ribs of iron would the two princes lie and claudio lie who loved her so that speaking of her foulness washd it with tears hence from her let her die friar it cannot be thou seest that all the grace that she hath left is that she will not add to her damnation a sin of perjury she not denies it why seekst thou then to cover with excuse that which appears in proper nakedness i know not if they speak but truth of her these hands shall tear her if they wrong her honour the proudest of them shall well hear of it time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine nor age so eat up my invention nor fortune made such havoc of my means nor my bad life reft me so much of friends but they shall find awaked in such a kind both strength of limb and policy of mind ability in means and choice of friends to quit me of them throughly what shall become of this what will this do being that i flow in grief the smallest twine may lead me i pray thee cease thy counsel which falls into mine ears as profitless as water in a sieve give not me counsel nor let no comforter delight mine ear but such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine bring me a father that so loved his child whose joy of her is overwhelmd like mine and bid him speak of patience measure his woe the length and breadth of mine and let it answer every strain for strain as thus for thus and such a grief for such in every lineament branch shape and form if such a one will smile and stroke his beard bid sorrow wag cry hem when he should groan patch grief with proverbs make misfortune drunk with candlewasters bring him yet to me and i of him will gather patience but there is no such man for brother men can counsel and speak comfort to that grief which they themselves not feel but tasting it their counsel turns to passion which before would give preceptial medicine to rage fetter strong madness in a silken thread charm ache with air and agony with words no no tis all mens office to speak patience to those that wring under the load of sorrow but no mans virtue nor sufficiency to be so moral when he shall endure the like himself therefore give me no counsel my griefs cry louder than advertisement i pray thee peace i will be flesh and blood for there was never yet philosopher that could endure the toothache patiently however they have writ the style of gods and made a push at chance and sufferance there thou speakst reason nay i will do so my soul doth tell me hero is belied and that shall claudio know so shall the prince and all of them that thus dishonour her hear you my lords some haste my lord well fare you well my lord are you so hasty now well all is one marry thou dost wrong me thou dissembler thou nay never lay thy hand upon thy sword i fear thee not tush tush man never fleer and jest at me i speak not like a dotard nor a fool as under privilege of age to brag what i have done being young or what would do were i not old know claudio to thy head thou hast so wrongd mine innocent child and me that i am forced to lay my reverence by and with grey hairs and bruise of many days do challenge thee to trial of a man i say thou hast belied mine innocent child thy slander hath gone through and through her heart and she lies buried with her ancestors o in a tomb where never scandal slept save this of hers framed by thy villany thine claudio thine i say my lord my lord ill prove it on his body if he dare despite his nice fence and his active practise his may of youth and bloom of lustihood canst thou so daff me thou

upon her tomb and sing it to her bones sing it tonight tomorrow morning come you to my house and since you could not be my soninlaw be yet my nephew my brother hath a daughter almost the copy of my child thats dead and she alone is heir to both of us give her the right you should have given her cousin and so dies my revenge tomorrow then i will expect your coming tonight i take my leave this

discharge thee of thy prisoner and i thank thee until tomorrow morning lords farewell to the watch  bring you these fellows on well talk with margaret how her acquaintance grew with this lewd fellow so are the prince and claudio who accused her upon the error that you heard debated but margaret was in some fault for this although against her will as it appears in the true course of all the question well daughter and you gentlewomen all withdraw into a chamber by yourselves and when i send for you come hither maskd   the prince and claudio promised by this hour to visit me you know your office brother you must be father to your brothers daughter and give her to young claudio that eye my daughter lent her tis most true the sight whereof i think you had from me from claudio and the prince but whats your will my heart is with your liking good morrow prince good morrow claudio we here attend you are you yet determined today to marry with my brothers daughter call her forth brother heres the friar ready no that you shall not till you take her hand before this friar and swear to marry her she died my lord but whiles her slander lived come cousin i am sure you love the gentleman well have dancing afterwardhe is very near by this he was not three leagues off when i left him but few of any sort and none of name much deserved on his part and equally remembered by don pedro he hath borne himself beyond the promise of his age doing in the figure of a lamb the feats of a lion he hath indeed better bettered expectation than you must expect of me to tell you how i have already delivered him letters and there appears much joy in him even so much that joy could not show itself modest enough without a badge of bitterness in great measure i know none of that name lady there was none such in the army of any sort o hes returned and as pleasant as ever he was he hath done good service lady in these wars and a good soldier too lady a lord to a lord a man to a man stuffed with all honourable virtues ist possible i see lady the gentleman is not in your books he is most in the company of the right noble claudio i will hold friends with you lady don pedro is approached my lord they stay for you to give your daughter to her husband my lord your brother john is taen in flight and brought with armed men back to messinai pray you is signior mountanto returned from the wars or no he set up his bills here in messina and challenged cupid at the flight and my uncles fool reading the challenge subscribed for cupid and challenged him at the birdbolt i pray you how many hath he killed and eaten in these wars but how many hath he killed for indeed i promised to eat all of his killing you had musty victual and he hath holp to eat it he is a very valiant trencherman he hath an excellent stomach and a good soldier to a lady but what is he to a lord it is so indeed he is no less than a stuffed man but for the stuffingwell we are all mortal alas he gets nothing by that in our last conflict four of his five wits went halting off and now is the whole man governed with one so that if he have wit enough to keep himself warm let him bear it for a difference between himself and his horse for it is all the wealth that he hath left to be known a reasonable creature who is his companion now he hath every month a new sworn brother very easily possible he wears his faith but as the fashion of his hat it ever changes with the next block no an he were i would burn my study but i pray you who is his companion is there no young squarer now that will make a voyage with him to the devil o lord he will hang upon him like a disease he is sooner caught than the pestilence and the taker runs presently mad god help the noble claudio if he have caught the benedick it will cost him a thousand pound ere a be cured do good friend no not till a hot january i wonder that you will still be talking signior benedick nobody marks you is it possible disdain should die while she hath such meet food to feed it as signior benedick courtesy itself must convert to disdain if you come in her presence a dear happiness to women they would else have been troubled with a pernicious suitor i thank god and my cold blood i am of your humour for that i had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man swear he loves me scratching could not make it worse an twere such a face as yours were a bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours you always end with a jades trick i know you of old how tartly that gentleman looks i never can see him but i am heartburned an hour after he were an excellent man that were made just in the midway between him and benedick the one is too like an image and says nothing and the other too like my ladys eldest son evermore tattling with a good leg and a good foot uncle and money enough in his purse such a man would win any woman in the world if a could get her goodwill too curst is more than curst i shall lessen gods sending that way for it is said god sends a curst cow short horns but to a cow too curst he sends none just if he send me no husband for the which blessing i am at him upon my knees every morning and evening lord i could not endure a husband with a beard on his face i had rather lie in the woollen what should i do with him dress him in my apparel and make him my waitinggentlewoman he that hath a beard is more than a youth and he that hath no beard is less than a man and he that is more than a youth is not for me and he that is less than a man i am not for him therefore i will even take sixpence in earnest of the bearward and lead his apes into hell no but to the gate and there will the devil meet me like an old cuckold with horns on his head and say get you to heaven beatrice get you to heaven heres no place for you maids so deliver i up my apes and away to saint peter for the heavens he shows me where the bachelors sit and there live we as merry as the day is long yes faith it is my cousins duty to make curtsy and say father as it please you but yet for all that cousin let him be a handsome fellow or else make another curtsy and say father as it please me not till god make men of some other metal than earth would it not grieve a woman to be overmastered with a pierce of valiant dust to make an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl no uncle ill none adams sons are my brethren and truly i hold it a sin to match in my kindred the fault will be in the music cousin if you be not wooed in good time if the prince be too important tell him there is measure in every thing and so dance out the answer for hear me hero wooing wedding and repenting is as a scotch jig a measure and a cinque pace the first suit is hot and hasty like a scotch jig and full as fantastical the wedding mannerlymodest as a measure full of state and ancientry and then comes repentance and with his bad legs falls into the cinque pace faster and faster till he sink into his grave i have a good eye uncle i can see a church by daylight will you not tell me who told you so nor will you not tell me who you are that i was disdainful and that i had my good wit out of the hundred merry taleswell this was signior benedick that said so i am sure you know him well enough did he never make you laugh why he is the princes jester a very dull fool only his gift is in devising impossible slanders none but libertines delight in him and the commendation is not in his wit but in his villany for he both pleases men and angers them and then they laugh at him and beat him i am sure he is in the fleet i would he had boarded me do do hell but break a comparison or two on me which peradventure not marked or not laughed at strikes him into melancholy and then theres a partridge wing saved for the fool will eat no supper that night   we must follow the leaders nay if they lead to any ill i will leave them at the next turning indeed my lord he lent it me awhile and i gave him use for it a double heart for his single one marry once before he won it of me with false dice therefore your grace may well say i have lost it so i would not he should do me my lord lest i should prove the mother of fools i have brought count claudio whom you sent me to seek the count is neither sad nor sick nor merry nor well but civil count civil as an orange and something of that jealous complexion speak count tis your cue speak cousin or if you cannot stop his mouth with a kiss and let not him speak neither yea my lord i thank it poor fool it keeps on the windy side of care my cousin tells him in his ear that he is in her heart good lord for alliance thus goes every one to the world but i and i am sunburnt i may sit in a corner and cry heighho for a husband i would rather have one of your fathers getting hath your grace neer a brother like you your father got excellent husbands if a maid could come by them no my lord unless i might have another for workingdays your grace is too costly to wear every day but i beseech your grace pardon me i was born to speak all mirth and no matter no sure my lord my mother cried but then there was a star danced and under that was i born cousins god give you joy i cry you mercy uncle by your graces pardon against my will i am sent to bid you come in to dinner i took no more pains for those thanks than you take pains to thank me if it had been painful i would not have come yea just so much as you may take upon a knifes point and choke a daw withal you have no stomach signior fare you well coming forward what fire is in mine ears can this be true stand i condemnd for pride and scorn so much contempt farewell and maiden pride adieu no glory lives behind the back of such and benedick love on i will requite thee taming my wild heart to thy loving hand if thou dost love my kindness shall incite thee to bind our loves up in a holy band for others say thou dost deserve and i believe it better than reportingly good morrow sweet hero i am out of all other tune methinks ye light o love with your heels then if your husband have stables enough youll see he shall lack no barns tis almost five oclock cousin tis time you were ready by my troth i am exceeding ill heighho for the letter that begins them all h what means the fool trow i am stuffed cousin i cannot smell o god help me god help me how long have you professed apprehension it is not seen enough you should wear it in your cap by my troth i am sick benedictus why benedictus you have some moral in this benedictus what pace is this that thy tongue keeps why how now cousin wherefore sink you down dead i think help uncle hero why hero uncle signior benedick friar how now cousin hero o on my soul my cousin is belied no truly not although until last night i have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow yea and i will weep a while longer you have no reason i do it freely ah how much might the man deserve of me that would right her a very even way but no such friend it is a mans office but not yours as strange as the thing i know not it were as possible for me to say i loved nothing so well as you but believe me not and yet i lie not i confess nothing nor i deny nothing i am sorry for my cousin do not swear and eat it will you not eat your word why then god forgive me you have stayed me in a happy hour i was about to protest i loved you i love you with so much of my heart that none is left to protest kill claudio you kill me to deny it farewell i am gone though i am here there is no love in you nay i pray you let me go in faith i will go you dare easier be friends with me than fight with mine enemy is he not approved in the height a villain that hath slandered scorned dishonoured my kinswoman o that i were a man what bear her in hand until they come to take hands and then with public accusation uncovered slander unmitigated rancour o god that i were a man i would eat his heart in the marketplace talk with a man out at a window a proper saying sweet hero she is wronged she is slandered she is undone princes and counties surely a princely testimony a goodly count count comfect a sweet gallant surely o that i were a man for his sake or that i had any friend would be a man for my sake but manhood is melted into courtesies valour into compliment and men are only turned into tongue and trim ones too he is now as valiant as hercules that only tells a lie and swears it i cannot be a man with wishing therefore i will die a woman with grieving use it for my love some other way than swearing by it yea as sure as i have a thought or a soul yea signior and depart when you bid me then is spoken fare you well now and yet ere i go let me go with that i came which is with knowing what hath passed between you and claudio foul words is but foul wind and foul wind is but foul breath and foul breath is noisome therefore i will depart unkissed for them all together which maintained so politic a state of evil that they will not admit any good part to intermingle with them but for which of my good parts did you first suffer love for me in spite of your heart i think alas poor heart if you spite it for my sake i will spite it for yours for i will never love that which my friend hates it appears not in this confession theres not one wise man among twenty that will praise himself and how long is that think you very ill very ill too will you go hear this news signior unmasking  i answer to that name what is your will why no no more than reason do not you love me why then my cousin margaret and ursula are much deceived for they did swear you did they swore that you were wellnigh dead for me no truly but in friendly recompense i would not deny you but by this good day i yield upon great persuasion and partly to save your life for i was told you were in a consumptionmy cousin means signior benedick of padua he is of a very melancholy disposition so you walk softly and look sweetly and say nothing i am yours for the walk and especially when i walk away i may say so when i please when i like your favour for god defend the lute should be like the case why then your visor should be thatched i will do any modest office my lord to help my cousin to a good husband good margaret run thee to the parlor there shalt thou find my cousin beatrice proposing with the prince and claudio whisper her ear and tell her i and ursula walk in the orchard and our whole discourse is all of her say that thou overheardst us and bid her steal into the pleached bower where honeysuckles ripend by the sun forbid the sun to enter like favourites made proud by princes that advance their pride against that power that bred it there will she hide her to listen our purpose  this is thy office bear thee well in it and leave us alone now ursula when beatrice doth come as we do trace this alley up and down our talk must only be of benedick when i do name him let it be thy part to praise him more than ever man did merit my talk to thee must be how benedick is sick in love with beatrice of this matter is little cupids crafty arrow made that only wounds by hearsay   now begin for look where beatrice like a lapwing runs close by the ground to hear our conference then go we near her that her ear lose nothing of the false sweet bait that we lay for it   no truly ursula she is too disdainful i know her spirits are as coy and wild as haggerds of the rock so says the prince and my newtrothed lord they did entreat me to acquaint her of it but i persuaded them if they loved benedick to wish him wrestle with affection and never to let beatrice know of it o god of love i know he doth deserve as much as may be yielded to a man but nature never framed a womans heart of prouder stuff than that of beatrice disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes misprising what they look on and her wit values itself so highly that to her all matter else seems weak she cannot love nor take no shape nor project of affection she is so selfendeared why you speak truth i never yet saw man how wise how noble young how rarely featured but she would spell him backward if fairfaced she would swear the gentleman should be her sister if black why nature drawing of an antique made a foul blot if tall a lance illheaded if low an agate very vilely cut if speaking why a vane blown with all winds if silent why a block moved with none so turns she every man the wrong side out and never gives to truth and virtue that which simpleness and merit purchaseth no not to be so odd and from all fashions as beatrice is cannot be commendable but who dare tell her so if i should speak she would mock me into air o she would laugh me out of myself press me to death with wit therefore let benedick like coverd fire consume away in sighs waste inwardly it were a better death than die with mocks which is as bad as die with tickling no rather i will go to benedick and counsel him to fight against his passion and truly ill devise some honest slanders to stain my cousin with one doth not know how much an ill word may empoison liking he is the only man of italy always excepted my dear claudio indeed he hath an excellent good name why every day tomorrow come go in ill show thee some attires and have thy counsel which is the best to furnish me tomorrow if it proves so then loving goes by haps some cupid kills with arrows some with traps good ursula wake my cousin beatrice and desire her to rise and bid her come hither no pray thee good meg ill wear this my cousins a fool and thou art another ill wear none but this o that exceeds they say god give me joy to wear it for my heart is exceeding heavy fie upon thee art not ashamed good morrow coz why how now do you speak in the sick tune these gloves the count sent me they are an excellent perfume there thou prickest her with a thistle help to dress me good coz good meg good ursula i do none my lord and seemd i ever otherwise to you is my lord well that he doth speak so wide true o god o god defend me how am i beset what kind of catechising call you this is it not hero who can blot that name with any just reproach i talkd with no man at that hour my lord they know that do accuse me i know none if i know more of any man alive than that which maiden modesty doth warrant let all my sins lack mercy o my father prove you that any man with me conversed at hours unmeet or that i yesternight maintaind

Pericles Prince of Tyre,young prince of tyre you have at large received the danger of the task you undertake bring in our daughter clothed like a bride for the embracements even of jove himself at whose conception till lucina reignd nature this dowry gave to glad her presence the senatehouse of planets all did sit to knit in her their best perfections prince pericles before thee stands this fair hesperides with golden fruit but dangerous to be touchd for deathlike dragons here affright thee hard her face like heaven enticeth thee to view her countless glory which desert must gain and which without desert because thine eye presumes to reach all thy whole heap must die yon sometimes famous princes like thyself drawn by report adventurous by desire tell thee with speechless tongues and semblance pale that without covering save yon field of stars here they stand martyrs slain in cupids wars and with dead cheeks advise thee to desist for going on deaths net whom none resist scorning advice read the conclusion then which read and not expounded tis decreed as these before thee thou thyself shalt bleed prince pericles touch not upon thy life for thats an article within our law as dangerous as the rest your times expired either expound now or receive your sentence aside  heaven that i had thy head he has found the meaning but i will gloze with himyoung prince of tyre though by the tenor of our strict edict your exposition misinterpreting we might proceed to cancel of your days yet hope succeeding from so fair a tree as your fair self doth tune us otherwise forty days longer we do respite you if by which time our secret be undone this mercy shows well joy in such a son and until then your entertain shall be as doth befit our honour and your worth he hath found the meaning for which we mean to have his head he must not live to trumpet forth my infamy nor tell the world antiochus doth sin in such a loathed manner and therefore instantly this prince must die for by his fall my honour must keep high who attends us there thaliard you are of our chamber and our mind partakes her private actions to your secrecy and for your faithfulness we will advance you thaliard behold heres poison and heres gold we hate the prince of tyre and thou must kill him it fits thee not to ask the reason why because we bid it say is it done enough   let your breath cool yourself telling your haste as thou wilt live fly after and like an arrow shot from a wellexperienced archer hits the mark his eye doth level at so thou neer return unless thou say prince pericles is dead thaliard adieu   till pericles be dead my heart can lend no succor to my headi have antiochus and with a soul emboldend with the glory of her praise think death no hazard in this enterprise see where she comes apparelld like the spring graces her subjects and her thoughts the king of every virtue gives renown to men her face the book of praises where is read nothing but curious pleasures as from thence sorrow were ever razed and testy wrath could never be her mild companion you gods that made me man and sway in love that have inflamed desire in my breast to taste the fruit of yon celestial tree or die in the adventure be my helps as i am son and servant to your will to compass such a boundless happiness that would be son to great antiochus antiochus i thank thee who hath taught my frail mortality to know itself and by those fearful objects to prepare this body like to them to what i must for death rememberd should be like a mirror who tells us lifes but breath to trust it error ill make my will then and as sick men do who know the world see heaven but feeling woe gripe not at earthly joys as erst they did so i bequeath a happy peace to you and all good men as every prince should do my riches to the earth from whence they came but my unspotted fire of love to you   thus ready for the way of life or death i wait the sharpest blow antiochus like a bold champion i assume the lists nor ask advice of any other thought but faithfulness and courage   i am no viper yet i feed on mothers flesh which did me breed i sought a husband in which labour i found that kindness in a father hes father son and husband mild i mother wife and yet his child how they may be and yet in two as you will live resolve it you sharp physic is the last but o you powers that give heaven countless eyes to view mens acts why cloud they not their sights perpetually if this be true which makes me pale to read it fair glass of light i loved you and could still   were not this glorious casket stored with ill but i must tell you now my thoughts revolt for hes no man on whom perfections wait that knowing sin within will touch the gate you are a fair viol and your sense the strings who fingerd to make man his lawful music would draw heaven down and all the gods to hearken but being playd upon before your time hell only danceth at so harsh a chime good sooth i care not for you great king few love to hear the sins they love to act twould braid yourself too near for me to tell it who has a book of all that monarchs do hes more secure to keep it shut than shown for vice repeated is like the wandering wind blows dust in others eyes to spread itself and yet the end of all is bought thus dear the breath is gone and the sore eyes see clear to stop the air would hurt them the blind mole casts coppd hills towards heaven to tell the earth is throngd by mans oppression and the poor worm doth die fort kings are earths gods in vice their laws their will and if jove stray who dares say jove doth ill it is enough you know and it is fit what being more known grows worse to smother it all love the womb that their first being bred then give my tongue like leave to love my head how courtesy would seem to cover sin when what is done is like an hypocrite the which is good in nothing but in sight if it be true that i interpret false then were it certain you were not so bad as with foul incest to abuse your soul where now youre both a father and a son by your untimely claspings with your child which pleasure fits an husband not a father and she an eater of her mothers flesh by the defiling of her parents bed and both like serpents are who though they feed on sweetest flowers yet they poison breed antioch farewell for wisdom sees those men blush not in actions blacker than the night will shun no course to keep them from the light one sin i know another doth provoke murders as near to lust as flame to smoke poison and treason are the hands of sin ay and the targets to put off the shame then lest my lie be croppd to keep you clear by flight ill shun the danger which i fear to lords without  let none disturb uswhy should this change of thoughts the sad companion dulleyed melancholy be my so used a guest as not an hour in the days glorious walk or peaceful night the tomb where grief should sleep can breed me quiet here pleasures court mine eyes and mine eyes shun them and danger which i feard is at antioch whose aim seems far too short to hit me here yet neither pleasures art can joy my spirits nor yet the others distance comfort me then it is thus the passions of the mind that have their first conception by misdread have afternourishment and life by care and what was first but fear what might be done grows elder now and cares it be not done and so with me the great antiochus gainst whom i am too little to contend since hes so great can make his will his act will think me speaking though i swear to silence nor boots it me to say i honour him if he suspect i may dishonour him and what may make him blush in being known hell stop the course by which it might be known with hostile forces hell oerspread the land and with the ostent of war will look so huge amazement shall drive courage from the state our men be vanquishd ere they do resist and subjects punishd that neer thought offence which care of them not pity of myself who am no more but as the tops of trees which fence the roots they grow by and defend them makes both my body pine and soul to languish and punish that before that he would punish all leave us else but let your cares oerlook what shipping and what ladings in our haven and then return to us   helicanus thou hast moved us what seest thou in our looks if there be such a dart in princes frowns how durst thy tongue move anger to our face thou knowst i have power to take thy life from thee rise prithee rise sit down thou art no flatterer i thank thee for it and heaven forbid that kings should let their ears hear their faults hid fit counsellor and servant for a prince who by thy wisdom makest a prince thy servant what wouldst thou have me do thou speakst like a physician helicanus that ministerst a potion unto me that thou wouldst tremble to receive thyself attend me then i went to antioch where as thou knowst against the face of death i sought the purchase of a glorious beauty from whence an issue i might propagate are arms to princes and bring joys to subjects her face was to mine eye beyond all wonder the resthark in thine earas black as incest which by my knowledge found the sinful father seemd not to strike but smooth but thou knowst this tis time to fear when tyrants seem to kiss such fear so grew in me i hither fled under the covering of a careful night who seemd my good protector and being here bethought me what was past what might succeed i knew him tyrannous and tyrants fears decrease not but grow faster than the years and should he doubt it as no doubt he doth that i should open to the listening air how many worthy princes bloods were shed to keep his bed of blackness unlaid ope to lop that doubt hell fill this land with arms and make pretence of wrong that i have done him when all for mine if i may call offence must feel wars blow who spares not innocence which love to all of which thyself art one who now reprovest me for it drew sleep out of mine eyes blood from my cheeks musings into my mind with thousand doubts how i might stop this tempest ere it came and finding little comfort to relieve them i thought it princely charity to grieve them i do not doubt thy faith but should he wrong my liberties in my absence tyre i now look from thee then and to tarsus intend my travel where ill hear from thee and by whose letters ill dispose myself the care i had and have of subjects good on thee i lay whose wisdoms strength can bear it ill take thy word for faith not ask thine oath who shuns not to break one will sure crack both but in our orbs well live so round and safe that time of both this truth shall neer convince thou showdst a subjects shine i a true prince lord governor for so we hear you are let not our ships and number of our men be like a beacon fired to amaze your eyes we have heard your miseries as far as tyre and seen the desolation of your streets nor come we to add sorrow to your tears but to relieve them of their heavy load and these our ships you happily may think are like the trojan horse was stuffd within with bloody veins expecting overthrow are stored with corn to make your needy bread and give them life whom hunger starved half dead arise i pray you rise we do not look for reverence but to love and harbourage for ourself our ships and men which welcome well accept feast here awhile until our stars that frown lend us a smile yet cease your ire you angry stars of heaven wind rain and thunder remember earthly man is but a substance that must yield to you and i as fits my nature do obey you alas the sea hath cast me on the rocks washd me from shore to shore and left me breath nothing to think on but ensuing death let it suffice the greatness of your powers to have bereft a prince of all his fortunes and having thrown him from your watery grave here to have death in peace is all hell crave aside  a pretty moral aside  simonides aside  how from the finny subject of the sea these fishers tell the infirmities of men and from their watery empire recollect all that may men approve or men detect peace be at your labour honest fishermen may see the sea hath cast upon your coast a man whom both the waters and the wind in that vast tenniscourt have made the ball for them to play upon entreats you pity him he asks of you that never used to beg i never practised it what i have been i have forgot to know but what i am want teaches me to think on a man throngd up with cold my veins are chill and have no more of life than may suffice to give my tongue that heat to ask your help which if you shall refuse when i am dead for that i am a man pray see me buried i thank you sir i did but crave why are all your beggars whipped then aside  how well this honest mirth becomes their labour not well the good king simonides do you call him he is a happy king since he gains from his subjects the name of good by his government how far is his court distant from this shore were my fortunes equal to my desires i could wish to make one there an armour friends i pray you let me see it thanks fortune yet that after all my crosses thou givest me somewhat to repair myself and though it was mine own part of my heritage which my dead father did bequeath to me with this strict charge even as he left his life keep it my pericles it hath been a shield twixt me and deathand pointed to this brace for that it saved me keep it in like necessity the which the gods protect thee frommay defend thee it kept where i kept i so dearly loved it till the rough seas that spare not any man took it in rage though calmd have givent again i thank thee fort my shipwreck nows no ill since i have here my fathers gift ins will to beg of you kind friends this coat of worth for it was sometime target to a king i know it by this mark he loved me dearly and for his sake i wish the having of it and that yould guide me to your sovereigns court where with it i may appear a gentleman and if that ever my low fortunes better ill pay your bounties till then rest your debtor ill show the virtue i have borne in arms believe t i will by your furtherance i am clothed in steel and spite of all the rapture of the sea this jewel holds his building on my arm unto thy value i will mount myself upon a courser whose delightful steps shall make the gazer joy to see him tread only my friend i yet am unprovided of a pair of bases then honour be but a goal to my will this day ill rise or else add ill to ill tis more by fortune lady than by merit some other is more fit you are right courteous knights by jove i wonder that is king of thoughts these cates resist me she but thought upon yon kings to me like to my fathers picture which tells me in that glory once he was had princes sit like stars about his throne and he the sun for them to reverence none that beheld him but like lesser lights did vail their crowns to his supremacy where now his sons like a glowworm in the night the which hath fire in darkness none in light whereby i see that times the king of men hes both their parent and he is their grave and gives them what he will not what they crave i thank him i thank both him and you and pledge him freely a gentleman of tyre my name pericles my education been in arts and arms who looking for adventures in the world was by the rough seas reft of ships and men and after shipwreck driven upon this shore in those that practise them they are my lord i am at your graces pleasure all fortune to the good simonides it is your graces pleasure to commend not my desert the worst of all her scholars my good lord a most virtuous princess as a fair day in summer wondrous fair i am unworthy for her schoolmaster aside  whats here a letter that she loves the knight of tyre tis the kings subtlety to have my life o seek not to entrap me gracious lord a stranger and distressed gentleman that never aimd so high to love your daughter but bent all offices to honour her by the gods i have not never did thought of mine levy offence nor never did my actions yet commence a deed might gain her love or your displeasure traitor even in his throatunless it be the king that calls me traitor i return the lie my actions are as noble as my thoughts that never relishd of a base descent i came unto your court for honours cause and not to be a rebel to her state and he that otherwise accounts of me this sword shall prove hes honours enemy then as you are as virtuous as fair resolve your angry father if my tongue did ere solicit or my hand subscribe to any syllable that made love to you even as my life or blood that

yet mayst thou prove prosperous of all sayd yet i wish thee happinessdoth your highness call my lord tis done my lord if i can get him within my pistols length ill make him sure enough so farewell to your highness so this is tyre and this the court here must i kill king pericles and if i do it not i am sure to be hanged at home tis dangerous well i perceive he was a wise fellow and had good discretion that being bid to ask what he would of the king desired he might know none of his secrets now do i see he had some reason fort for if a king bid a man be a villain hes bound by the indenture of his oath to be one hush here come the lords of tyre aside  how the king gone aside          what from antioch aside  well i perceive i shall not be hangd now although i would but since hes gone the kings seas must please he scaped the land to perish at the sea ill present myself peace to the lords of tyre from him i come with message unto princely pericles but since my landing i have understood your lord has betook himself to unknown travels my message must return from whence it camemy lord prince pericles is fledjoy and all comfort in your sacred breast they are my liege and stay your coming to present themselves follow me then lord helicane a word know that our griefs are risen to the top and now at length they overflow their banks wrong not yourself then noble helicane but if the prince do live let us salute him or know what grounds made happy by his breath if in the world he live well seek him out if in his grave he rest well find him there and be resolved he lives to govern us or dead gives cause to mourn his funeral and leave us to our free election to wisdom hes a fool that will not yield and since lord helicane enjoineth us we with our travels will endeavour us sir we have a maid in mytilene i durst wager would win some words of himand keep your mind till you return to us peaceful and comfortable it shall no longer grieve without reproof whose death indeeds the strongest in our censure and knowing this kingdom is without a head like goodly buildings left without a roof soon fall to ruinyour noble self that best know how to rule and how to reign we thus submit untoour sovereignpeace peace and give experience tongue they do abuse the king that flatter him for flattery is the bellows blows up sin the thing which is flatterd but a spark to which that blast gives heat and stronger glowing whereas reproof obedient and in order fits kings as they are men for they may err when signior sooth here does proclaim a peace he flatters you makes war upon your life prince pardon me or strike me if you please i cannot be much lower than my knees an angry brow dread lord how dare the plants look up to heaven from whence they have their nourishment kneeling i have ground the axe myself do you but strike the blow to bear with patience such griefs as you yourself do lay upon yourself alas sir well my lord since you have given me leave to speak freely will i speak antiochus you fear and justly too i think you fear the tyrant who either by public war or private treason will take away your life therefore my lord go travel for a while till that his rage and anger be forgot or till the destinies do cut his thread of life your rule direct to any if to me day serves not light more faithful than ill be well mingle our bloods together in the earth from whence we had our being and our birth you shall not need my fellow peers of tyre further to question me of your kings departure his seald commission left in trust with me doth speak sufficiently hes gone to travel if further yet you will be satisfied why as it were unlicensed of your loves he would depart ill give some light unto you being at antioch royal antiochuson what cause i know not took some displeasure at him at least he judged so and doubting lest that he had errd or sinnd to show his sorrow held correct himself so puts himself unto the shipmans toil with whom each minute threatens life or death lord thaliard from antiochus is welcome we have no reason to desire it commended to our master not to us yet ere you shall depart this we desire as friends to antioch we may feast in tyre no escanes know this of me antiochus from incest lived not free for which the most high gods not minding longer to withhold the vengeance that they had in store due to this heinous capital offence even in the height and pride of all his glory when he was seated in a chariot of an inestimable value and his daughter with him a fire from heaven came and shrivelld up their bodies even to loathing for they so stunk that all those eyes adored them ere their fall scorn now their hand should give them burial and yet but justice for though this king were great his greatness was no guard to bar heavens shaft but sin had his reward with me and welcome happy day my lords your griefs for what wrong not your prince you love for honours cause forbear your suffrages if that you love prince pericles forbear take i your wish i leap into the seas wheres hourly trouble for a minutes ease a twelvemonth longer let me entreat you to forbear the absence of your king if in which time expired he not return i shall with aged patience bear your yoke but if i cannot win you to this love go search like nobles like noble subjects and in your search spend your adventurous worth whom if you find and win unto return you shall like diamonds sit about his crown then you love us we you and well clasp hands when peers thus knit a kingdom ever stands that he have his call up some gentlemen gentlemen theres some of worth would come aboard i pray ye greet them fairly and you sir to outlive the age i am and die as i would do first what is your place sir our vessel is of tyre in it the king a man who for this three months hath not spoken to any one nor taken sustenance but to prorogue his grief twould be too tedious to repeat but the main grief springs from the loss of a beloved daughter and a wife you may but bootless is your sight he will not speak to any behold him   this was a goodly person till the disaster that one mortal night drove him to this it is in vain he will not speak to you sure alls effectless yet nothing well omit that bears recoverys name but since your kindness we have stretchd thus far let us beseech you that for our gold we may provision have wherein we are not destitute for want but weary for the staleness sit sir i will recount it to you but see i am prevented shes a gallant lady calls my lord i know not but here is the regent sir of mytilene speaks

will practise on this drunken man what think you if he were conveyd to bed wrappd in sweet clothes rings put upon his fingers a most delicious banquet by his bed and brave attendants near him when he wakes would not the beggar then forget himself even as a flattering dream or worthless fancy then take him up and manage well the jest carry him gently to my fairest chamber and hang it round with all my wanton pictures balm his foul head in warm distilled waters and burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet procure me music ready when he wakes to make a dulcet and a heavenly sound and if he chance

observed in noble ladies unto their lords by them accomplished such duty to the drunkard let him do with soft low tongue and lowly courtesy and say what ist your honour will command wherein your lady and your humble wife may show her duty and make known her love and then with kind embracements tempting kisses and with declining head into his bosom bid him shed tears as being overjoyd to see her noble lord restored to health who for this seven years hath esteemd him no better than a poor and loathsome beggar and if the boy have not a womans gift to rain a shower of commanded tears an onion

any thing the image tell me that hath kept with thy remembrance thou hadst and more miranda but how is it that this lives in thy mind what seest thou else in the dark backward and abysm of time if thou rememberst aught ere thou camest here how thou camest here thou mayst twelve year since miranda twelve year since thy father was the duke of milan and a prince of power thy mother was a piece of virtue and she said thou wast my daughter and thy father was duke of milan and thou his only heir and princess no worse issued both both my girl by foul play as thou sayst were we heaved thence but blessedly holp hither my brother and thy uncle calld antonio i pray thee mark methat a brother should be so perfidioushe whom next thyself of all the world i loved and to him put the manage of my state as at that time through all the signories it was the first and prospero the prime duke being so reputed in dignity and for the liberal arts without a parallel those being all my study the government i cast upon my brother and to my state grew stranger being transported and rapt in secret studies thy false uncle dost thou attend me being once perfected how to grant suits how to deny them who to advance and who to trash for overtopping new created the creatures that were mine i say or changed em or else new formd em having both the key of officer and office set all hearts i the state to what tune pleased his ear that now he was the ivy which had hid my princely trunk and suckd my verdure out ont thou attendst not i pray thee mark me i thus neglecting worldly ends all dedicated to closeness and the bettering of my mind with that which but by being so retired oerprized all popular rate in my false brother awaked an evil nature and my trust like a good parent did beget of him a falsehood in its contrary as great as my trust was which had indeed no limit a confidence sans bound he being thus lorded not only with what my revenue yielded but what my power might else exact like one who having into truth by telling of it made such a sinner of his memory to credit his own lie he did believe he was indeed the duke out o the substitution and executing the outward face of royalty with all prerogative hence his ambition growing dost thou hear to have no screen between this part he playd and him he playd it for he needs will be absolute milan me poor man my library was dukedom large enough of temporal royalties he thinks me now incapable confederates so dry he was for swaywi the king of naples to give him annual tribute do him homage subject his coronet to his crown and bend the dukedom yet unbowdalas poor milan to most ignoble stooping mark his condition and the event then tell me if this might be a brother now the condition the king of naples being an enemy to me inveterate hearkens my brothers suit which was that he in lieu o the premises of homage and i know not how much tribute should presently extirpate me and mine out of the dukedom and confer fair milan with all the honours on my brother whereon a treacherous army levied one midnight fated to the purpose did antonio open the gates of milan and i the dead of darkness the ministers for the purpose hurried thence me and thy crying self hear a little further and then ill bring thee to the present business which nows upons without the which this story were most impertinent well demanded wench my tale provokes that question dear they durst not so dear the love my people bore me nor set a mark so bloody on the business but with colours fairer painted their foul ends in few they hurried us aboard a bark bore us some leagues to sea where they prepared a rotten carcass of a boat not riggd nor tackle sail nor mast the very rats instinctively had quit it there they hoist us to cry to the sea that roard to us to sigh to the winds whose pity sighing back again did us but loving wrong o a cherubim thou wast that did preserve me thou didst smile infused with a fortitude from heaven when i have deckd the sea with drops full salt under my burthen groand which raised in me an undergoing stomach to bear up against what should ensue by providence divine some food we had and some fresh water that a noble neapolitan gonzalo out of his charity being then appointed master of this design did give us with rich garments linens stuffs and necessaries which since have steaded much so of his gentleness knowing i loved my books he furnishd me from mine own library with volumes that i prize above my dukedom now i arise   sit still and hear the last of our seasorrow here in this island we arrived and here have i thy schoolmaster made thee more profit than other princesses can that have more time for vainer hours and tutors not so careful know thus far forth by accident most strange bountiful fortune now my dear lady hath mine enemies brought to this shore and by my prescience i find my zenith doth depend upon a most auspicious star whose influence if now i court not

her servant and for thou wast a spirit too delicate to act her earthy and abhorrd commands refusing her grand hests she did confine thee by help of her more potent ministers and in her most unmitigable rage into a cloven pine within which rift imprisond thou didst painfully remain a dozen years within which space she died and left thee there where thou didst vent thy groans as fast as

troilus alas hath none the greeks are strong and skilful to their strength fierce to their skill and to their fierceness valiant but i am weaker than a womans tear tamer than sleep fonder than ignorance less valiant than the virgin in the night and skilless as unpractised infancy have i not tarried have i not tarried still have i tarried patience herself what goddess eer she be doth lesser blench at sufferance than i do at priams royal table do i sit and when fair cressid comes into my thoughts so traitor when she comes when is she thence i was about to tell theewhen my heart as wedged with a sigh would rive in twain lest hector or my father should perceive me i have as when the sun doth light a storm buried this sigh in wrinkle of a smile but sorrow that is couchd in seeming gladness is like that mirth fate turns to sudden sadness o pandarus i tell thee pandarus when i do tell thee there my hopes lie drownd reply not in how many fathoms deep they lie indrenchd i tell thee i am mad in cressids love thou answerst she is fair pourst in the open ulcer of my heart her eyes her hair her cheek her gait her voice handlest in thy discourse o that her hand in whose comparison all whites are ink writing their own reproach to whose soft seizure the cygnets down is harsh and spirit of sense hard as the palm of ploughman this thou tellst me as true thou tellst me when i say i love her but saying thus instead of oil and balm thou layst in every gash that love hath given me the knife that made it thou dost not speak so much good pandarus how now pandarus what art thou angry pandarus what with me say i she is not fair pandarus sweet pandarus peace you ungracious clamours peace rude sounds fools on both sides helen must needs be fair when with your blood you daily paint

abroad are you bound thither come go we then together fie fie my brother weigh you the worth and honour of a king so great as our dread father in a scale of common ounces will you with counters sum the past proportion of his infinite and buckle in a waist most fathomless with spans and inches so diminutive as fears and reasons fie for godly shame you are for dreams and slumbers brother priest you fur your gloves with reason here are your reasons you know an enemy intends you harm you know a sword employd is perilous and reason flies the object of all harm who marvels then when helenus beholds a grecian and his sword if he do set the very wings of reason to his heels and fly like chidden mercury from jove or like a star disorbd nay if we talk of reason lets shut our gates and sleep manhood and honour should have harehearts would they but fat their thoughts with this crammd reason reason and respect make livers pale and lustihood deject what is aught but as tis valued i take today a wife and my election is led on in the conduct of my will my will enkindled by mine eyes and ears two traded pilots twixt the dangerous shores of will and judgment how may i avoid although my will distaste what it elected the wife i chose there can be no evasion to blench from this and to stand firm by honour we turn not back the silks upon the merchant when we have soild them nor the remainder viands we do not throw in unrespective sieve because we now are full it was thought meet paris should do some vengeance on the greeks your breath of full consent bellied his sails the seas and winds old wranglers took a truce and did him service he touchd the ports desired and for an old aunt whom the greeks held captive he brought a grecian queen whose youth and freshness wrinkles apollos and makes stale the morning why keep we her the grecians keep our aunt is she worth keeping why she is a pearl whose price hath launchd above a thousand ships and turnd crownd kings to

stoln what we do fear to keep but thieves unworthy of a thing so stoln that in their country did them that disgrace we fear to warrant in our native place tis our mad sister i do know her voice why brother hector we may not think the justness of each act such and no other than event doth form it nor once deject the courage of our minds because cassandras mad her brainsick raptures cannot distaste the goodness of a quarrel which hath our several honours all engaged to make it gracious for my private part i am no more touchd than all priams sons and jove forbid there should be done amongst us such things as might offend the weakest spleen to fight for and maintain why there you touchd the life of our design were it not glory that we more affected than the performance of our heaving spleens i would not wish a drop of trojan blood spent more in her defence but worthy hector she is a theme of honour and renown a spur to valiant and magnanimous deeds whose present courage may beat down our foes and fame in time to come canonize us for i presume brave hector would not lose so rich advantage of a promised glory as smiles upon the forehead of this action for the wide worlds revenue sirrah walk off no pandarus i stalk about her door like a strange soul upon the stygian banks staying for waftage o be thou my charon and give me swift transportance to those fields

heaps the enemy flying even such a passion doth embrace my bosom my heart beats thicker than a feverous pulse and all my powers do their bestowing lose like vassalage at unawares encountering the eye of majesty you have bereft me of all words lady o cressida how often have i wished me thus what should they grant what makes this pretty abruption what too curious dreg espies my sweet lady in the fountain of our love fears make devils of cherubims they never see truly o let my lady apprehend no fear in all cupids pageant there is presented no monster nothing but our undertakings when we vow to weep seas live in fire eat rocks tame tigers thinking it harder for our mistress to devise imposition enough than for us to undergo any difficulty imposed this is the monstruosity in love lady that the will is infinite and the execution confined that the desire is boundless and the act a slave to limit are there such such are not we praise us as we are tasted allow us as we prove our head shall go bare till merit crown it no perfection in reversion shall have a praise in present we will not name desert before his birth and being born his addition shall be humble few words to fair faith troilus shall be such to cressid as what envy can say worst shall be a mock for his truth and what truth can speak truest not truer than troilus you know now your hostages your uncles word and my firm faith why was my cressid then so hard to win and shall albeit sweet music issues thence your leave sweet cressid what offends you lady you cannot shun yourself well know they what they speak that speak so wisely o that i thought it could be in a woman as if it can i will presume in you to feed for aye her ramp and flames of love to keep her constancy in plight and youth outliving beautys outward with a mind that doth renew swifter than blood decays or that persuasion could but thus convince me that my integrity and truth to you might be affronted with the match and weight of such a winnowd purity in love how were i then uplifted but alas i am as true as truths simplicity and simpler than the infancy of truth o virtuous fight when right with right wars who shall be most right true swains in love shall in the world to come approve their truths by troilus when their rhymes full of protest of oath and big compare want similes truth tired with iteration as true as steel as plantage to the moon as sun to day as turtle to her mate as iron to adamant as earth to the centre yet after all comparisons of truth as truths authentic author to be cited as true as troilus shall crown up the verse and sanctify the numbers amen dear trouble not yourself the morn is cold trouble him not to bed to bed sleep kill those pretty eyes and give as soft attachment to thy senses as infants empty of all thought i prithee now to bed o cressida but that the busy day waked by the lark hath roused the ribald crows and dreaming night will hide our joys no longer i would not from thee beshrew the witch with venomous wights she stays as tediously as hell but flies the grasps of love with wings more momentaryswift than thought you will catch cold and curse me it is your uncle ha ha how now whats the matter is it so concluded how my achievements mock me i will go meet them and my lord aeneas we met by chance you did not find me here walk into her house ill bring her to the grecian presently and to his hand when i deliver her think it an altar and thy brother troilus a priest there offering to it his own heart cressid i love thee in so straind a purity that the blessd gods as angry with my fancy more bright in zeal than the devotion which cold lips blow to their deities take thee from me a hateful truth from troy and troilus and suddenly where injury of chance puts back leavetaking justles roughly by all time of pause rudely beguiles our lips of all rejoindure forcibly prevents our lockd embrasures strangles our dear vows even in the birth of our own labouring breath we two that with so many thousand sighs did buy each other must poorly sell ourselves with the rude brevity and discharge of one injurious time now with a robbers haste crams his rich thievery up he knows not how as many farewells as be stars in heaven with distinct breath and consignd kisses to them he fumbles up into a lose adieu and scants us with a single famishd kiss distasted with the salt of broken tears hark you are calld some say the genius so cries come to him that instantly must die bid them have patience she shall come anon no remedy hear me my love be thou but true of heart nay we must use expostulation kindly for it is parting from us i speak not be thou true as fearing thee for i will throw my glove to death himself that theres no maculation in thy heart but be thou true say i to fashion in my sequent protestation be thou true and i will see thee and ill grow friend with danger wear this sleeve i will corrupt the grecian sentinels to give thee nightly visitation but yet be true hear while i speak it love the grecian youths are full of quality theyre loving well composed with gifts of nature flowing and swelling oer with arts and exercise how novelty may move and parts with person alas a kind of godly jealousy which i beseech you call a virtuous sin makes me afeard die i a villain then in this i do not call your faith in question so mainly as my merit i cannot sing nor heel the high lavolt nor sweeten talk nor play at subtle games fair virtues all to which the grecians are most prompt and pregnant but i can tell that in each grace of these there lurks a still and dumbdiscoursive devil that tempts most cunningly but be not tempted no but something may be done that we will not and sometimes we are devils to ourselves when we will tempt the frailty of our powers presuming on their changeful potency come kiss and let us part good brother come you hither and bring aeneas and the grecian with you who i alas it is my vice my fault whiles others fish with craft for great opinion i with great truth catch mere simplicity whilst some with cunning gild their copper crowns with truth and plainness i do wear mine bare fear not my truth the moral of my wit is plain and true theres all the reach of it   welcome sir diomed here is the lady which for antenor we deliver you at the port lord ill give her to thy hand and by the way possess thee what she is entreat her fair and by my soul fair greek if eer thou stand at mercy of my sword name cressida and thy life shall be as safe as priam is in ilion grecian thou dost not use me courteously to shame the zeal of my petition to thee in praising her i tell thee lord of greece she is as far highsoaring oer thy praises as thou unworthy to be calld her servant i charge thee use her

strokes his cheek nay stay by jove i will not speak a word there is between my will and all offences a guard of patience stay a little while fear me not sweet lord i will not be myself nor have cognition of what i feel i am all patience o beauty where is thy faith i will be patient outwardly i will i did swear patience wert thou the devil and worest it on thy horn it should be challenged it is to make a recordation to my soul of every syllable that here was spoke but if i tell how these two did coact shall i not lie in publishing a truth sith yet there is a credence in my heart an esperance so obstinately strong that doth invert the attest of eyes and ears as if those organs had deceptious functions created only to calumniate was cressid here she was not sure why my negation hath no taste of madness let it not be believed for womanhood think we had mothers do not give advantage to stubborn critics apt without a theme for depravation to square the general sex by cressids rule rather think this not cressid nothing at all unless that this were she this she no this is diomeds cressida if beauty have a soul this is not she if souls guide vows if vows be sanctimonies if sanctimony be the gods delight if there be rule in unity itself this is not she o madness of discourse that cause sets up with and against itself bifold authority where reason can revolt without perdition and loss assume all reason without revolt this is and is not cressid within my soul there doth conduce a fight of this strange nature that a thing inseparate divides more wider than the sky and earth and yet the spacious breadth of this division admits no orifex for a point as subtle as ariachnes broken woof to enter instance o instance strong as plutos gates cressid is mine tied with the bonds of heaven instance o instance strong as heaven itself the bonds of heaven are slippd dissolved and loosed and with another knot fivefingertied the fractions of her faith orts of her love the fragments scraps the bits and greasy relics of her oereaten faith are bound to diomed ay greek and that shall be divulged well in characters as red as mars his heart inflamed with venus never did young man fancy with so eternal and so fixd a soul hark greek as much as i do cressid love so much by weight hate i her diomed that sleeve is mine that hell bear on his helm were it a casque composed by vulcans skill my sword should bite it not the dreadful spout which shipmen do the hurricano call constringed in mass by the almighty sun shall dizzy with more clamour neptunes ear in his descent than shall my prompted sword falling on diomed o cressid o false cressid false false false let all untruths stand by thy stained name and theyll seem glorious have with you prince my courteous lord adieu farewell revolted fair and diomed stand fast and wear a castle on thy head accept distracted thanks brother you have a vice of mercy in you which better fits a lion than a man when many times the captive grecian falls even in the fan and wind of your fair sword you bid them rise and live fools play by heaven hector for the love of all the gods lets leave the hermit pity with our mothers and when we have our armours buckled on the venomd vengeance ride upon our swords spur them to ruthful work rein them from ruth hector then tis wars who should withhold me not fate obedience nor the

Twelfth Night,if music be the food of love play on give me excess of it that surfeiting the appetite may sicken and so die that strain again it had a dying fall o it came oer my ear like the sweet sound that breathes upon a bank of violets stealing and giving odour enough no more tis not so sweet now as it was before o spirit of love how quick and fresh art thou that notwithstanding thy capacity receiveth as the sea nought enters there of what validity and pitch soeer but falls into abatement and low price even in a minute so full of shapes is fancy that it alone is high fantastical what curio why so i do the noblest that i have o when mine eyes did see olivia first methought she purged the air of pestilence that instant was i turnd into a hart and my desires like fell and cruel hounds eer since pursue me   how now what news from her stand you a while aloof cesario thou knowst no less but all i have unclaspd to thee the book even of my secret soul therefore good youth address thy gait unto her be not denied access stand at her doors and tell them there thy fixed foot shall grow till thou have audience o then unfold the passion of my love surprise her with discourse of my dear faith it shall become thee well to act my woes she will attend it better in thy youth than in a nuncios of more grave aspect dear lad believe it for they shall yet belie thy happy years that say thou art a man dianas lip is not more smooth and rubious thy small pipe is as the maidens organ shrill and sound and all is semblative a womans part i know thy constellation is right apt for this affair some four or five attend him all if you will for i myself am best when least in company prosper well in this and thou shalt live as freely as thy lord to call his fortunes thine give me some music now good morrow friends now good cesario but that piece of song that old and antique song we heard last night methought it did relieve my passion much more than light airs and recollected terms of these most brisk and giddypaced times come but one verse who was it seek him out and play the tune the while   come hither boy if ever thou shalt love in the sweet pangs of it remember me for such as i am all true lovers are unstaid and skittish in all motions else save in the constant image of the creature that is beloved how dost thou like this tune thou dost speak masterly my life upont

sways she level in her husbands heart for boy however we do praise ourselves our fancies are more giddy and unfirm more longing wavering sooner lost and worn than womens are then let thy love be younger than thyself or thy affection cannot hold the bent for women are as roses whose fair flower being once displayd doth fall that very hour theres for thy pains ill pay thy pleasure then give me now leave to leave thee let all the rest give place   once more cesario get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty tell her my love more noble than the world prizes not quantity of dirty lands the parts that fortune hath bestowd upon her tell her i hold as giddily as fortune but tis that miracle and queen of gems that nature pranks her in attracts my soul i cannot be so answerd there is no womans sides can bide the beating of so strong a passion as love doth give my heart no womans heart so big to hold so much they lack retention alas their love may be calld appetite no motion of the liver but the palate that suffer surfeit cloyment and revolt but mine is all as hungry as the sea and can digest as much make no compare between that love a woman can bear me and that i owe olivia but died thy

tenderd what shall i do why should i not had i the heart to do it like to the egyptian thief at point of death kill what i lovea savage jealousy that sometimes savours nobly but hear me this since you to nonregardance cast my faith and that i partly know the instrument that screws me from my true place in your favour live you the marblebreasted tyrant still but this your minion whom i know you love

in he is about the houseso please my lord i might not be admitted but from her handmaid do return this answer the element itself till seven years heat shall not behold her face at ample view but like a cloistress she will veiled walk and water once a day her chamber round with eyeoffending brine all this to season a brothers dead love which she would keep fresh and lasting in her sad remembrance if the duke continue these favours towards you cesario you are like to be much advanced he hath known you but three days and already you are no stranger no believe meo she that hath a heart of that fine frame to pay this debt of love but to a brother how will she love when the rich golden shaft hath killd the flock of all affections else that live in her when liver brain and heart these sovereign thrones are all supplied and filld her sweet perfections with one self king away before me to sweet beds of flowers lovethoughts lie rich when canopied with bowers who saw cesario ho be clamorous and leap all civil bounds rather than make unprofited return she is not worth thee then what years i faith o fellow come the song we had last night mark it cesario it is old and plain the

Two Gentlemen of Verona,cease to persuade my loving proteus homekeeping youth have ever homely wits weret not affection chains thy tender days to the sweet glances of thy honourd love i rather would entreat thy company to see the wonders of the world abroad than living dully sluggardized at home wear out thy youth with shapeless idleness but since thou lovest love still and thrive therein even as i would when i to love begin and on a lovebook pray for my success thats on some shallow story of deep love how young leander crossd the hellespont tis true for you are over boots in love and yet you never swum the hellespont no i will not for it boots thee not to be in love where scorn is bought with groans coy looks with heartsore sighs one fading moments mirth with twenty watchful weary tedious nights if haply won perhaps a hapless gain if lost why then a grievous labour won however but a folly bought with wit or else a wit by folly vanquished so by your circumstance i fear youll prove love is your master for he masters you and he that is so yoked by a fool methinks should not be chronicled for wise and writers say as the most forward bud is eaten by the canker ere it blow even so by love the young and tender wit is turnd to folly blasting in the bud losing his verdure even in the prime and all the fair effects of future hopes but wherefore waste i time to counsel thee that art a votary to fond desire once more adieu my father at the road expects my coming there to see me shippd sweet proteus no now let us take our leave to milan let me hear from thee by letters of thy success

good lord a son that well deserves the honour and regard of such a father i know him as myself for from our infancy we have conversed and spent our hours together and though myself have been an idle truant omitting the sweet benefit of time to clothe mine age with angellike perfection yet hath sir proteus for thats his name made use and fair advantage of his days his years but young but his experience old his head unmellowd but his judgment ripe and in a word for far behind his worth comes all the praises that i now bestow he is complete in feature and in mind with all good grace to grace a gentleman should i have wishd a thing it had been he this is the gentleman i told your ladyship had come along with me but that his mistress did hold his eyes lockd in her crystal looks nay

imperious thoughts have punishd me with bitter fasts with penitential groans with nightly tears and daily heartsore sighs for in revenge of my contempt of love love hath chased sleep from my enthralled eyes and made them watchers of mine own hearts sorrow o gentle proteus loves a mighty lord and hath so humbled me as i confess there is no woe to his correction nor to his service no such joy on earth now no discourse except it be of love now can i break my fast dine sup and sleep upon the very naked name of love even she and is she not a heavenly saint call her divine o flatter me for

love and i will help thee to prefer her too she shall be dignified with this high honour to bear my ladys train lest the base earth should from her vesture chance to steal a kiss and of so great a favour growing proud disdain to root the summerswelling flower and make rough winter everlastingly pardon me proteus all i can is nothing to her whose worth makes other worthies nothing she is alone

take no repulse whatever she doth say for get you gone she doth not mean away flatter and praise commend extol their graces though neer so black say they have angels faces that man that hath a tongue i say is no man if with his tongue he cannot win a woman why then i would resort to her by night what lets but one may enter at her window why then a ladder quaintly made of cords to cast up with a

to save your ship from wreck which cannot perish having thee aboard being destined to a drier death on shore   i must go send some better messenger i fear my julia would not deign my lines receiving them from such a worthless post sweet love sweet lines sweet life here is her hand the agent of her heart here is her oath for love her honours pawn o that our fathers would applaud our loves to seal our happiness with their consents o heavenly julia mayt please your lordship tis a word or two of commendations sent from valentine deliverd by a friend that came from him there is no news my lord but that he writes how happily he lives how well beloved and daily graced by the emperor wishing me with him partner of his fortune as one relying on your lordships will and not depending on his friendly wish my lord i cannot be so soon provided please you deliberate a day or two thus have i shunnd the fire for fear of burning and drenchd me in the sea where i am drownd i feard to show my father julias letter lest he should take exceptions to my love and with the vantage of mine own excuse hath he excepted most against my love o how this spring of love resembleth the uncertain glory of an april day which now shows all the beauty of the sun and by and by a cloud takes all away why this it is my heart accords thereto and yet a thousand times it answers no have patience gentle julia when possibly i can i will return why then well make exchange here take you this here is my hand for my true constancy and when that hour oerslips me in the day wherein i sigh not julia for thy sake the next ensuing hour some foul mischance torment me for my loves forgetfulness my father stays my coming answer not the tide is now nay not thy tide of tears that tide will stay me longer than i should julia farewell   what gone without a word ay so true love should do it cannot speak for truth hath better deeds than words to grace it go i come i come alas this parting strikes poor lovers dumb not so sweet  lady but too mean a servant to have a look of such a worthy mistress my duty will i boast of nothing else ill die on him that says so but yourself that you are worthless well both attend upon your ladyship your friends are well and have them much commended i left them all in health my tales of love were wont to weary you i know you joy not in a love discourse enough i read your fortune in your eye was this the idol that you worship so no but she is an earthly paragon i will not flatter her when i was sick you gave me bitter pills and i must minister the like to you except my mistress have i not reason to prefer mine own why valentine what braggardism is this then let her alone but she loves you go on before i shall inquire you forth i must unto the road to disembark some necessaries that i needs must use and then ill presently attend you i will   even as one heat another heat expels or as one nail by strength drives out another so the remembrance of my former love is by a newer object quite forgotten is it mine or valentines praise her true perfection or my false transgression that makes me reasonless to reason thus she is fair and so is julia that i love that i did love for now my love is thawd which like a waxen image gainst a fire bears no impression of the thing it was methinks my zeal to valentine is cold and that i love him not as i was wont o but i love his lady too too much and thats the reason i love him so little how shall i dote on her with more advice that thus without advice begin to love her tis but her picture i have yet beheld and that hath dazzled my reasons light but when i look on her perfections there is no reason but i shall be blind if i can cheque my erring love i will if not to compass her ill use my skill to leave my julia shall i be forsworn to love fair silvia shall i be forsworn to wrong my friend i shall be much forsworn and even that power which gave me first my oath provokes me to this threefold perjury love bade me swear and love bids me forswear o sweetsuggesting love if thou hast sinned teach me thy tempted subject to excuse it at first i did adore a twinkling star but now i worship a celestial sun unheedful vows may heedfully be broken and he wants wit that wants resolved will to learn his wit to exchange the bad for better fie fie unreverend tongue to call her bad whose sovereignty so oft thou hast preferrd with twenty thousand soulconfirming oaths i cannot leave to love and yet i do but there i leave to love where i should love julia i lose and valentine i lose if i keep them i needs must lose myself if i lose them thus find i by their loss for valentine myself for julia silvia i to myself am dearer than a friend for love is still most precious in itself and silviawitness heaven that made her fair shows julia but a swarthy ethiope i will forget that julia is alive remembering that my love to her is dead and valentine ill hold an enemy aiming at silvia as a sweeter friend i cannot now prove constant to myself without some treachery used to valentine this night he meaneth with a corded ladder to climb celestial silvias chamberwindow myself in counsel his competitor now presently ill give her father notice of their disguising and pretended flight who all enraged will banish valentine for thurio he intends shall wed his daughter but valentine being gone ill quickly cross by some sly trick blunt thurios dull proceeding love lend me wings to make my purpose swift as thou hast lent me wit to plot this drift my gracious lord that which i would discover the law of friendship bids me to conceal but when i call to mind your gracious favours done to me undeserving as i am my duty pricks me on to utter that which else no worldly good should draw from me know worthy prince sir valentine my friend this night intends to steal away your daughter myself am one made privy to the plot i know you have determined to bestow her on thurio whom your gentle daughter hates and should she thus be stoln away from you it would be much vexation to your age thus for my dutys sake i rather chose to cross my friend in his intended drift than by concealing it heap on your head a pack of sorrows which would press you down being unprevented to your timeless grave know noble lord they have devised a mean how he her chamberwindow will ascend and with a corded ladder fetch her down for which the youthful lover now is gone and this way comes he with it presently where if it please you you may intercept him but good my lord do it so cunningly that my discovery be not aimed at for love of you not hate unto my friend hath made me publisher of this pretence adieu my lord sir valentine is coming run boy run run and seek him out what seest thou valentine who then his spirit what then who wouldst thou strike villain forbear sirrah i say forbear friend valentine a word then in dumb silence will i bury mine for they are harsh untuneable and bad no valentine no valentine that thou art banishedo thats the news from hence from silvia and from me thy friend ay ay and she hath offerd to the doom which unreversed stands in effectual force a sea of melting pearl which some call tears those at her fathers churlish feet she tenderd with them upon her knees her humble self wringing her hands whose whiteness so became them as if but now they waxed pale for woe but neither bended knees pure hands held up sad sighs deep groans nor silvershedding tears could penetrate her uncompassionate sire but valentine if he be taen must die besides her intercession chafed him so when she for thy repeal was suppliant that to close prison he commanded her with many bitter threats of biding there cease to lament for that thou canst not help and study help for that which thou lamentst time is the nurse and breeder of all good here if thou stay thou canst not see thy love besides thy staying will abridge thy life hope is a lovers staff walk hence with that and manage it against despairing thoughts thy letters may be here though thou art hence which being writ to me shall be deliverd even in the milkwhite bosom of thy love the time now serves not to expostulate come ill convey thee through the citygate and ere i part with thee confer at large of all that may concern thy loveaffairs as thou lovest silvia though not for thyself regard thy danger and along with me go sirrah find him out come valentine gone my good lord a little time my lord will kill that grief longer than i prove loyal to your grace let me not live to look upon your grace i do my lord she did my lord when valentine was here the best way is to slander valentine with falsehood cowardice and poor descent three things that women highly hold in hate ay if his enemy deliver it therefore it must with circumstance be spoken by one whom she esteemeth as his friend and that my lord i shall be loath to do tis an ill office for a gentleman especially against his very friend you have prevaild my lord if i can do it by ought that i can speak in his dispraise she shall not long continue love to him but say this weed her love from valentine it follows not that she will love sir thurio as much as i can do i will effect but you sir thurio are not sharp enough you must lay lime to tangle her desires by wailful sonnets whose composed rhymes should be fullfraught with serviceable vows say that upon the altar of her beauty you sacrifice your tears your sighs your heart write till your ink be dry and with your tears moist it again and frame some feeling line that may discover such integrity for orpheus lute was strung with poets sinews whose golden touch could soften steel and stones make tigers tame and huge leviathans forsake unsounded deeps to dance on sands after your direlamenting elegies visit by night your ladys chamberwindow with some sweet concert to their instruments tune a deploring dump the nights dead silence will well become such sweetcomplaining grievance this or else nothing will inherit her well wait upon your grace till after supper and afterward determine our proceedings already have i been false to valentine and now i must be as unjust to thurio under the colour of commending him i have access my own love to prefer but silvia is too fair too true too holy to be corrupted with my worthless gifts when i protest true loyalty to her she twits me with my falsehood to my friend when to her beauty i commend my vows she bids me think how i have been forsworn in breaking faith with julia whom i loved and notwithstanding all her sudden quips the least whereof would quell a lovers hope yet spaniellike the more she spurns my love the more it grows and fawneth on her still but here comes thurio now must we to her window and give some evening music to her ear ay gentle thurio for you know that love will creep in service where it cannot go sir but i do or else i would be hence ay silvia for your sake sir thurio fear not you i will so plead that you shall say my cunning drift excels at saint gregorys well madam good even to your ladyship one lady if you knew his pure hearts truth you would quickly learn to know him by his voice sir proteus gentle lady and your servant that i may compass yours i grant sweet love that i did love a lady but she is dead i likewise hear that valentine is dead sweet lady let me rake it from the earth madam if your heart be so obdurate vouchsafe me yet your picture for my love the picture that is hanging in your chamber to that ill speak to that ill sigh and weep for since the substance of your perfect self is

Winters Tale,if you shall chance camillo to visit bohemia on the like occasion whereon my services are now on foot you shall see as i have said great difference betwixt our bohemia and your sicilia wherein our entertainment shall shame us we will be justified in our loves for indeed verily i speak it in the freedom of my knowledge we cannot with such magnificencein so rarei know not what to say we will give you sleepy drinks that your senses unintelligent of our insufficience may though they cannot praise us as little accuse us believe me i speak as my understanding instructs me and as mine honesty puts it to utterance i think there is not in the world either malice or matter to alter it you have an unspeakable comfort of your young prince mamillius it is a gentleman of the greatest promise that ever came into my note would they else be content to die if the king had no son they would desire to live on crutches till he had onei think this coming summer the king of sicilia means to pay bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him beseech you you pay a great deal too dear for whats given freely sicilia cannot show himself overkind to bohemia they were trained together in their childhoods and there rooted betwixt them then such an affection which cannot choose but branch now since their more mature dignities and royal necessities made separation of their society their encounters though not personal have been royally attorneyed with interchange of gifts letters loving embassies that they have seemed to be together though absent shook hands as over a vast and embraced as it were from the ends of opposed winds the heavens continue their loves i very well agree with you in the hopes of him it is a gallant child one that indeed physics the subject makes old hearts fresh they that went on crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to see him a man yes if there were no other excuse why they should desire to live ay my good lord you had much ado to make his anchor hold when you cast out it still came home he would not stay at your petitions made his business more material at the good queens entreaty business my lord i think most understand bohemia stays here longer stays here longer to satisfy your highness and the entreaties of our most gracious mistress be it forbid my lord my gracious lord i may be negligent foolish and fearful in every one of these no man is free but that his negligence his folly fear among the infinite doings of the world sometime puts forth in your affairs my lord if ever i were wilfulnegligent it was my folly if industriously i playd the fool it was my negligence not weighing well the end if ever fearful to do a thing where i the issue doubted where of the execution did cry out against the nonperformance twas a fear which oft infects the wisest these my lord are such allowd infirmities that honesty is never free of but beseech your grace be plainer with me let me know my trespass by its own visage if i then deny it tis none of mine i would not be a standerby to hear my sovereign mistress clouded so without my present vengeance taken shrew my heart you never spoke what did become you less than this which to reiterate were sin as deep as that though true good my lord be cured of this diseased opinion and betimes for tis most dangerous no no my lord who does infect her sir my lord i could do this and that with no rash potion but with a lingering dram that should not work maliciously like poison but i cannot believe this crack to be in my dread mistress so sovereignly being honourable i have loved thee i must believe you sir i do and will fetch off bohemia fort provided that when hes removed your highness will take again your queen as yours at first even for your sons sake and thereby for sealing the injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms known and allied to yours my lord go then and with a countenance as clear as friendship wears at feasts keep with bohemia and with your queen i am his cupbearer if from me he have wholesome beverage account me not your servant ill dot my lord o miserable lady but for me what case stand i in i must be the poisoner of good polixenes and my ground to dot is the obedience to a master one who in rebellion with himself will have all that are his so too to do this deed promotion follows if i could find example of thousands that had struck anointed kings and flourishd after ild not dot but since nor brass nor stone nor parchment bears not one let villany itself forsweart i must forsake the court to dot or no is certain to me a breakneck happy star reign now here comes bohemia hail most royal sir none rare my lord i dare not know my lord there is a sickness which puts some of us in distemper but i cannot name the disease and it is caught of you that yet are well i may not answer sir i will tell you since i am charged in honour and by him that i think honourable therefore mark my counsel which must be even as swiftly followd as i mean to utter it or both yourself and me cry lost and so good night i am appointed him to murder you by the king he thinks nay with all confidence he swears as he had seent or been an instrument to vice you tot that you have touchd his queen forbiddenly swear his thought over by each particular star in heaven and by all their influences you may as well forbid the sea for to obey the moon as or by oath remove or counsel shake the fabric of his folly whose foundation is piled upon his faith and will continue the standing of his body i know not but i am sure tis safer to avoid whats grown than question how tis born if therefore you dare trust my honesty that lies enclosed in this trunk which you shall bear along impawnd away tonight your followers i will whisper to the business and will by twos and threes at several posterns clear them o the city for myself ill put my fortunes to your service which are here by this discovery lost be not uncertain for by the honour of my parents i have utterd truth which if you seek to prove i dare not stand by nor shall you be safer than one condemnd by the kings own mouth thereon his execution sworn it is in mine authority to command the keys of all the posterns please your highness to take the urgent hour come sir away it is fifteen years since i saw my country though i have for the most part been aired abroad i desire to lay my bones there besides the penitent king my master hath sent for me to whose feeling sorrows i might be some allay or i oerween to think so which is another spur to my departure sir it is three days since i saw the prince what his happier affairs may be are to me unknown but i have missingly noted he is of late much retired from court and is less frequent to his princely exercises than formerly he hath appeared i have heard sir of such a man who hath a daughter of most rare note the report of her is extended more than can be thought to begin from such a cottage i willingly obey your command i should leave grazing were i of your flock and only live by gazing he tells her something that makes her blood look out good sooth she is the queen of curds and cream this shows a sound affection why how now father speak ere thou diest gracious my lord you know your fathers temper at this time he will allow no speech which i do guess you do not purpose to him and as hardly will he endure your sight as yet i fear then till the fury of his highness settle come not before him even he my lord be advised this is desperate sir o my lord i would your spirit were easier for advice or stronger for your need hes irremoveable resolved for flight now were i happy if his going i could frame to serve my turn save him from danger do him love and honour purchase the sight again of dear sicilia and that unhappy king my master whom i so much thirst to see sir i think you have heard of my poor services i the love that i have borne your father well my lord if you may please to think i love the king and through him what is nearest to him which is your gracious self embrace but my direction if your more ponderous and settled project may suffer alteration on mine honour ill point you where you shall have such receiving as shall become your highness where you may enjoy your mistress from the whom i see theres no disjunction to be made but by as heavens forefendyour ruin marry her and with my best endeavours

undergo this flight make for sicilia and there present yourself and your fair princess for so i see she must be fore leontes she shall be habited as it becomes the partner of your bed methinks i see leontes opening his free arms and weeping his welcomes forth asks thee the son forgiveness as twere i the fathers person kisses the hands of your fresh princess oer and oer divides him twixt his unkindness and his kindness the one he chides to hell and bids the other grow faster than thought or time sent by the king your father to greet him and to give him comforts sir the manner of your bearing towards him with what you as from your father shall deliver things known betwixt us three ill write you down the which shall point you forth at every sitting what you must say that he shall not perceive but that you have your fathers bosom there and speak his very heart a cause more promising than a wild dedication of yourselves to unpathd waters undreamd shores most certain to miseries enough no hope to help you but as you shake off one to take another nothing so certain as your anchors who do their best office if they can but stay you where youll be loath to be besides you know prosperitys the very bond of love whose fresh complexion and whose heart together affliction alters yea say you so there shall not at your fathers house these seven years be born another such i cannot

sped the better by my regard but killd none so camillo as you are certainly a gentleman thereto clerklike experienced which no less adorns our gentry than our parents noble names in whose success we are gentlei beseech you if you know aught which does behove my knowledge thereof to be informd imprisont not in ignorant concealment a sickness caught of me and yet i well i must be answerd dost thou hear camillo i conjure thee by all the parts of man which honour does acknowledge whereof the least is not this suit of mine that thou declare what incidency thou dost guess of harm is creeping toward

did expect my hence departure two days ago this jealousy is for a precious creature as shes rare must it be great and as his persons mighty must it be violent and as he does conceive he is dishonourd

death to grant this as thou lovest me camillo wipe not out the rest of thy services by leaving me now the need i have of thee thine own goodness hath made better not to have had thee than thus to want thee thou having made me businesses which none without thee can sufficiently manage must either stay to execute them thyself or take away with thee the very services thou hast done which if i have not enough considered as too much i cannot to be more thankful to thee shall be my study and my profit therein the heaping friendships of that fatal country sicilia prithee speak no more whose very naming punishes me with the remembrance of that penitent as thou callest him and reconciled king my brother whose loss of his most precious queen and children are even now to be afresh lamented say to me when sawest thou the prince florizel my son kings are no less unhappy their issue not being gracious than they are in losing them when they have approved their virtues i have considered so much camillo and with some care so far that i have eyes under my service which look upon his removedness from whom i have this intelligence that he is seldom from the house of a most homely shepherd a man they say that from very nothing and beyond the imagination of his neighbours is grown into an unspeakable estate thats likewise part of my intelligence but i fear the angle that plucks our son thither thou shalt accompany us to the place where we will not appearing what we are have some question with the shepherd from whose simplicity i think it not uneasy to get the cause of my sons resort thither prithee be my present partner in this business and lay aside the thoughts of sicilia my best camillo we must disguise ourselves shepherdess a fair one are youwell you fit our ages with flowers of winter wherefore gentle maiden do you neglect them say there be yet nature is made better by no mean but nature makes that mean so over that art which you say adds to nature is an art that nature makes you see sweet maid we marry a gentler scion to the wildest stock and make conceive a bark of baser kind by bud of nobler race this is an art which does mend nature change it rather but the art

violent hefts i have drunk and seen the spider camillo was his help in this his pander there is a plot against my life my crown alls true that is mistrusted that false villain whom i employd was preemployd by him he has discoverd my design and i remain a pinchd thing yea a very trick for them to play at will how came the posterns so easily open i knowt too well give me the boy i am glad you did not nurse him though he does bear some signs of me yet you have too much blood in him bear the boy hence he shall not come about her away with him and let her sport herself with that shes big with

honourable praise her but for this her withoutdoor form which on my faith deserves high speech and straight the shrug the hum or ha these petty brands that calumny doth useo i am out that mercy does for calumny will sear virtue itself these shrugs these hums and has when you have said shes goodly come between ere you can say shes honest but be t known from him that has most cause to grieve it should be shes an adulteress you have mistook my lady polixenes for leontes o thou thing which ill not call a creature of thy place lest barbarism making me the precedent should a like language use to all degrees and mannerly distinguishment leave out betwixt the prince and beggar i have said shes an adulteress i have said with whom more shes a traitor and camillo is a federary with her and one that knows what she should shame to know herself but with her most vile principal that shes a bedswerver even as bad as those that vulgars give boldst titles ay and privy to this their late escape no

Henry IV part 1,so shaken as we are so wan with care find we a time for frighted peace to pant and breathe shortwinded accents of new broils to be commenced in strands afar remote no more the thirsty entrance of this soil shall daub her lips with her own childrens blood nor more shall trenching war channel her fields nor bruise her flowerets with the armed hoofs of hostile paces those opposed eyes which like the meteors of a troubled heaven all of one nature of one substance bred did lately meet in the intestine shock and furious close of civil butchery shall now in mutual wellbeseeming ranks march all one way and be no more opposed against acquaintance kindred and allies the edge of war like an illsheathed knife no more shall cut his master therefore friends as far as to the sepulchre of christ whose soldier now under whose blessed cross we are impressed and engaged to fight forthwith a power of english shall we levy whose arms were moulded in their mothers womb to chase these pagans in those holy fields over whose acres walkd those blessed feet which fourteen hundred years ago were naild for our advantage on the bitter cross but this our purpose now is twelve month old and bootless tis to tell you we will go therefore we meet not now then let me hear of you my gentle cousin westmoreland what yesternight our council did decree in forwarding this dear expedience it seems then that the tidings of this broil brake off our business for the holy land here is a dear a true industrious friend sir walter blunt new lighted from his horse staind with the variation of each soil betwixt that holmedon and this seat of ours and he hath brought us smooth and welcome news the earl of douglas is discomfited ten thousand bold scots two and twenty knights balkd in their own blood did sir walter see on holmedons plains of prisoners hotspur took mordake the earl of fife and eldest son to beaten douglas and the earl of athol of murray angus and menteith and is not this an honourable spoil a gallant prize ha cousin is it not but i have sent for him to answer this and for this cause awhile we must neglect our holy purpose to jerusalem cousin on wednesday next our council we will hold at windsor so inform the lords but come yourself with speed to us again for more is to be said and to be done than out of anger can be uttered my blood hath been too cold and temperate unapt to stir at these indignities and you have found me for accordingly you tread upon my patience but be sure i will from henceforth rather be myself mighty and to be feard than my condition which hath been smooth as oil soft as young down and therefore lost that title of respect which the proud soul neer pays but to the proud worcester get thee gone for i do see danger and disobedience in thine eye o sir your presence is too bold and peremptory and majesty might never yet endure the moody frontier of a servant brow you have good leave to leave us when we need your use and counsel we shall send for you   you were about to speak why yet he doth deny his prisoners but with proviso and exception that we at our own charge shall ransom straight his brotherinlaw the foolish mortimer who on my soul hath wilfully betrayd the lives of those that he did lead to fight against that great magician damnd glendower whose daughter as we hear the earl of march hath lately married shall our coffers then be emptied to redeem a traitor home shall we but treason and indent with fears when they have lost and forfeited themselves no on the barren mountains let him starve for i shall never hold that man my friend whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost to ransom home revolted mortimer lords give us leave the prince of wales and i must have some private conference but be near at hand for we shall presently have need of you   i know not whether god will have it so for some displeasing service i have done that in his secret doom out of my blood hell breed revengement and a scourge for me but thou dost in thy passages of life make me believe that thou art only markd for the hot vengeance and the rod of heaven to punish my mistreadings tell me else could such inordinate and low desires such poor such bare such lewd such mean attempts such barren pleasures rude society as thou art matchd withal and grafted to accompany the greatness of thy blood and hold their level with thy princely heart a hundred thousand rebels die in this thou shalt have charge and sovereign trust herein   how now good blunt thy looks are full of speed the earl of westmoreland set forth today with him my son lord john of lancaster for this advertisement is five days old on wednesday next harry you shall set forward on thursday we ourselves will march our meeting is bridgenorth and harry you shall march through gloucestershire by which account our business valued some twelve days hence our general forces at bridgenorth shall meet our hands are full of business lets away advantage feeds him fat while men delay then with the losers let it sympathize for nothing can seem foul to those that win     how now my lord of worcester tis not well that you and i should meet upon such terms as now we meet you have deceived our trust and made us doff our easy robes of peace to crush our old limbs in ungentle steel this is not well my lord this is not well what say you to it will you again unknit this curlish knot of allabhorred war and move in that obedient orb again where you did give a fair and natural light and be no more an exhaled meteor a prodigy of fear and a portent of broached mischief to the unborn times you have not sought it how comes it then these things indeed you have articulate proclaimd at marketcrosses read in churches to face the garment of rebellion with some fine colour that may please the eye of fickle changelings and poor discontents which gape and rub the elbow at the news of hurlyburly innovation and never yet did insurrection want such watercolours to impaint his cause nor moody beggars starving for a time of pellmell havoc and confusion and prince of wales so dare we venture thee albeit considerations infinite do make against it no good worcester no we love our people well even those we love that are misled upon your cousins part and will they take the offer of our grace both he and they and you every man shall be my friend again and ill be his so tell your cousin and bring me word what he will do but if he will not yield rebuke and dread correction wait on us and they shall do their office so be gone we will not now be troubled with reply we offer fair take it advisedly hence therefore every leader to his charge for on their answer will we set on them and god befriend us as our cause is just i will do so my lord of westmoreland lead him to his tent i saw him hold lord percy at the point with lustier maintenance than i did look for of such an ungrown warrior the king himself who douglas grieves at heart so many of his shadows thou hast met and not the very king i have two boys seek percy and thyself about the field but seeing thou fallst on me so luckily i will assay thee so defend thyself stay and breathe awhile thou hast redeemd thy lost opinion and showd thou makest some tender of my life in this fair rescue thou hast brought to me make up to clifton ill to sir nicholas gawsey thus ever did rebellion find rebuke illspirited worcester did not we send grace pardon and terms of love to all of you and wouldst thou turn our offers contrary misuse the tenor of thy kinsmans trust three knights upon our party slain today a noble earl and many a creature else had been alive this hour if like a christian thou hadst truly borne betwixt our armies true intelligence bear worcester to the death and vernon too other offenders we will pause upon   how goes the field with all my heart then this remains that we divide our power you son john and my cousin westmoreland towards york shall bend you with your dearest speed to meet northumberland and the prelate scroop who as we hear are busily in arms myself and you son harry will towards wales to fight with glendower and the earl of march rebellion in this land shall lose his sway meeting the cheque of such another day and since this business so fair is done let us not leave till all our own be wonmy liege this haste was hot in question and many limits of the charge set down but yesternight when all athwart there came a post from wales loaden with heavy news whose worst was that the noble mortimer leading the men of herefordshire to fight against the irregular and wild glendower was by the rude hands of that welshman taken a thousand of his people butchered upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse such beastly shameless transformation by those welshwomen done as may not be without much shame retold or spoken of this matchd with other did my gracious lord for more uneven and unwelcome news came from the north and thus it did import on holyrood day the gallant hotspur there young harry percy and brave archibald that evervaliant and approved scot at holmedon met where they did spend a sad and bloody hour as by discharge of their artillery and shape of likelihood the news was told for he that brought them in the very heat and pride of their contention did take horse uncertain of the issue any way in faith it is a conquest for a prince to boast of this is his uncles teaching this is worcester malevolent to you in all aspects which makes him prune himself and bristle up the crest of youth against your dignity i will my liege faith sir johntis more than time that i were there and you too but my powers are there already the king i can tell you looks for us all we must away all night ay but sir john methinks they are exceeding poor and bare too beggarly he is sir john i fear we shall stay too long come my lord ill lead you to your tentyea there thou makest me sad and makest me sin in envy that my lord northumberland should be the father to so blest a son a son who is the theme of honours tongue amongst a grove the very straightest plant who is sweet fortunes minion and her pride whilst i by looking on the praise of him see riot and dishonour stain the brow of my young harry o that it could be proved that some nighttripping fairy had exchanged in cradleclothes our children where they lay and calld mine percy his plantagenet then would i have his harry and he mine but let him from my thoughts what think you coz of this young percys pride the prisoners which he in this adventure hath surprised to his own use he keeps and sends me word i shall have none but mordake earl of fife god pardon thee yet let me wonder harry at thy affections which do hold a wing quite from the flight of all thy ancestors thy place in council thou hast rudely lost which by thy younger brother is supplied and art almost an alien to the hearts of all the court and princes of my blood the hope and expectation of thy time is ruind and the soul of every man prophetically doth forethink thy fall had i so lavish of my presence been so commonhackneyd in the eyes of men so stale and cheap to vulgar company opinion that did help me to the crown had still kept loyal to possession and left me in reputeless banishment a fellow of no mark nor likelihood by being seldom seen i could not stir but like a comet i was wonderd at that men would tell their children this is he others would say where which is bolingbroke and then i stole all courtesy from heaven and dressd myself in such humility that i did pluck allegiance from mens hearts loud shouts and salutations from their mouths even in the presence of the crowned king thus did i keep my person fresh and new my presence like a robe pontifical neer seen but wonderd at and so my state seldom but sumptuous showed like a feast and won by rareness such solemnity the skipping king he ambled up and down with shallow jesters and rash bavin wits soon kindled and soon burnt carded his state mingled his royalty with capering fools had his great name profaned with their scorns and gave his countenance against his name to laugh at gibing boys and stand the push of every beardless vain comparative grew a companion to the common streets enfeoffd himself to popularity that being daily swallowd by mens eyes they surfeited with honey and began to loathe the taste of sweetness whereof a little more than a little is by much too much so when he had occasion to be seen he was but as the cuckoo is in june heard not regarded seen but with such eyes as sick and blunted with community afford no extraordinary gaze such as is bent on sunlike majesty when it shines seldom in admiring eyes but rather drowzed and hung their eyelids down slept in his face and renderd such aspect as cloudy men use to their adversaries being with his presence glutted gorged and full and in that very line harry standest thou for thou has lost thy princely privilege with vile participation not an eye but is aweary of thy common sight save mine which hath desired to see thee more which now doth that i would not have it do make blind itself with foolish tenderness for all the world as thou art to this hour was richard then when i from france set foot at ravenspurgh and even as i was then is percy now now by my sceptre and my soul to boot he hath more worthy interest to the state than thou the shadow of succession for of no right nor colour like to right he doth fill fields with harness in the realm turns head against the lions armed jaws and being no more in debt to years than thou leads ancient lords and reverend bishops on to bloody battles and to bruising arms what neverdying honour hath he got against renowned douglas whose high deeds whose hot incursions and great name in arms holds from all soldiers chief majority and military title capital through all the kingdoms that acknowledge christ thrice hath this hotspur mars in swathling clothes this infant warrior in his enterprises discomfited great douglas taen him once enlarged him and made a friend of him to fill the mouth of deep defiance up and shake the peace and safety of our throne and what say you to this percy northumberland the archbishops grace of york douglas mortimer capitulate against us and are up but wherefore do i tell these news to thee why harry do i tell thee of my foes which art my nearst and dearest enemy thou that art like enough through vassal fear base inclination and the start of spleen to fight against me under percys pay to dog his heels and curtsy at his frowns to show how much thou art degenerate how bloodily the sun begins to peer above yon busky hill the day looks pale at his distemperaturenow hal what time of day is it lad indeed you come near me now hal for we that take purses go by the moon and the seven stars and not by phoebus hethat wandering knight so fair and i prithee sweet wag when thou art king as god save

Henry IV part 2,open your ears for which of you will stop the vent of hearing when loud rumour speaks i from the orient to the drooping west making the wind my posthorse still unfold the acts commenced on this ball of earth upon my tongues continual slanders ride the which in every language i pronounce stuffing the ears of men with false reports i speak of peace while covert enmity under the smile of safety wounds the world and who but rumour who but only i make fearful musters and prepared defence whiles the big year swoln with some other grief is thought with child by the stern tyrant war and no such matter rumour is a pipe blown by surmises jealousies conjectures and of so easy and so plain a stop that the blunt monster with uncounted heads the stilldiscordant wavering multitude can play upon it but what need i thus my wellknown body to anatomize among my household why is rumour here i run before king harrys victory who in a bloody field by shrewsbury hath beaten down young hotspur and his troops quenching the flame of bold rebellion even with the rebels blood but what mean i to speak so true at first my office is to noise abroad that harry monmouth fell under the wrath of noble hotspurs sword and that the king before the douglas rage stoopd his anointed head as low as death this have i rumourd through the peasant towns between that royal field of shrewsbury and this wormeaten hold of ragged stone where hotspurs father old northumberland lies craftysick the posts come tiring on and not a man of them brings other news than they have learnd of me

my barony never talk of it yea marry theres the point but if without him we be thought too feeble my judgment is we should not step too far till we had his assistance by the hand for in a theme so bloodyfaced as this conjecture expectation and surmise of aids incertain should not be admitted god save your grace come you virtuous ass you bashful fool must you be blushing wherefore blush you now

he himself wilt answertell thou the earl that the lord bardolph doth attend him here noble earl i bring you certain news from shrewsbury i spake with one my lord that came from thence a gentleman well bred and of good name that freely renderd me these news for true who he he was some hilding fellow that had stolen the horse he rode on and upon my life spoke at a venture look here comes more news i cannot think my lord your son is dead sweet earl divorce not wisdom from your honour we all that are engaged to this loss knew that we ventured on such dangerous seas that if we wrought our life twas ten to one and yet we ventured for the gain proposed choked the respect of likely peril feard and since we are oerset venture again come we will all put forth body and goods the question then lord hastings standeth thus whether our present five and twenty thousand may hold up head without northumberland it was my lord who lined himself with hope eating the air on promise of supply flattering himself in project of a power much smaller than the smallest of his thoughts and so with great imagination proper to madmen led his powers to death and winking leapd into destruction yes if this present quality of war indeed the instant action a cause on foot lives so in hope as in an early spring we see the appearing buds which to prove fruit hope gives not so much warrant as despair that frosts will bite them when we mean to build we first survey the plot then draw the model and when we see the figure of the house then must we rate the cost of the erection which if we find outweighs ability what do we then but draw anew the model in fewer offices or at last desist to build at all much more in this great work which is almost to pluck a kingdom down and set another up should we survey the plot of situation and the model consent upon a sure foundation question surveyors know our own estate how able such a work to undergo to weigh against his opposite or else we fortify in paper and in figures using the names of men instead of men like one that draws the model of a house beyond his power to build it who half through gives oer and leaves his partcreated cost a naked subject to the weeping clouds and waste for churlish winters tyranny what is the king but five and twenty thousand who is it like should lead his forces hitherwhat news lord bardolph every minute now should be the father of some stratagem the times are wild contention like a horse full of high feeding madly hath broke loose and bears down all before him good an god will how is this derived saw you the field came you from shrewsbury here comes my servant travers whom i sent on tuesday last to listen after news now travers what good tidings comes with you ha again said he young harry percys spur was cold of hotspur coldspur that rebellion had met ill luck why should that gentleman that rode by travers give then such instances of loss yea this mans brow like to a titleleaf foretells the nature of a tragic volume so looks the strand whereon the imperious flood hath left a witnessd usurpation say morton didst thou come from shrewsbury how doth my son and brother thou tremblest and the whiteness in thy cheek is apter than thy tongue to tell thy errand even such a man so faint so spiritless so dull so dead in look so woebegone drew priams curtain in the dead of night and would have told him half his troy was burnt but priam found the fire ere he his tongue and i my percys death ere thou reportst it this thou wouldst say your son did thus and thus your brother thus so fought the noble douglas stopping my greedy ear with their bold deeds but in the end to stop my ear indeed thou hast a sigh to blow away this praise ending with brother son and all are dead why he is dead see what a ready tongue suspicion hath he that but fears the thing he would not know hath by instinct knowledge from others eyes that what he feard is chanced yet speak morton tell thou an earl his divination lies and i will take it as a sweet disgrace and make thee rich for doing me such wrong yet for all this say not that percys dead i see a strange confession in thine eye thou shakest thy head and holdst it fear or sin to speak a truth if he be slain say so the tongue offends not that reports his death and he doth sin that doth belie the dead not he which says the dead is not alive yet the first bringer of unwelcome news hath but a losing office and his tongue sounds ever after as a sullen bell rememberd tolling a departing friend for this i shall have time enough to mourn in poison there is physic and these news having been well that would have made me sick being sick have in some measure made me well and as the wretch whose feverweakend joints like strengthless hinges buckle under life impatient of his fit breaks like a fire out of his keepers arms even so my limbs weakend with grief being now enraged with grief are thrice themselves hence therefore thou nice crutch a scaly gauntlet now with joints of steel must glove this hand and hence thou sickly quoif thou art a guard too wanton for the head which princes fleshd with conquest aim to hit now bind my brows with iron and approach the raggedst hour that time and spite dare bring to frown upon the enraged northumberland let heaven kiss earth now let not natures hand keep the wild flood confined let order die and let this world no longer be a stage to feed contention in a lingering act but let one spirit of the firstborn cain reign in all bosoms that each heart being set on bloody courses the rude scene may end and darkness be the burier of the dead i knew of this before but to speak truth this present grief had wiped it from my mind go in with me and counsel every man the aptest way for safety and revenge get posts and letters and make friends with speed never so few and never yet more need i pray thee loving wife and gentle daughter give even way unto my rough affairs put not you on the visage of the times and be like them to percy troublesome lady i have given over i will speak no more do what you will your wisdom be your guide alas sweet wife my honour is at pawn and but my going nothing can redeem it beshrew your heart fair daughter you do draw my spirits from me with new lamenting ancient oversights but i must go and meet with danger there or it will seek me in another place and find me worse provided lady o fly to scotland till that the nobles and the armed commons have of their puissance made a little taste come come go in with me tis with my mind as with the tide swelld up unto his height that makes a stillstand running neither way fain would i go to meet the archbishop but many thousand reasons hold me back i will resolve for scotland there am i till time and vantage crave my companymy lord sir john umfrevile turnd me back with joyful tidings and being better horsed outrode me after him came spurring hard a gentleman almost forspent with speed that stoppd by me to breathe his bloodied horse he askd the way to chester and of him i did demand what news from shrewsbury he told me that rebellion had bad luck and that young harry percys spur was cold with that he gave his able horse the head and bending forward struck his armed heels against the panting sides of his poor jade up to the rowelhead and starting so he seemd in running to devour the way staying no longer question this strained passion doth you wrong my lordi ran from shrewsbury my noble lord where hateful death put on his ugliest mask to fright our party douglas is living and your brother yet but for my lord your son you are too great to be by me gainsaid your spirit is too true your fears too certain i am sorry i should force you to believe that which i would to god i had not seen but these mine eyes saw him in bloody state rendering faint quittance wearied and outbreathed to harry monmouth whose swift wrath beat down the neverdaunted percy to the earth from whence with life he never more sprung up in few his death whose spirit lent a fire even to the dullest peasant in his camp being bruited once took fire and heat away from the best temperd courage in his troops for from his metal was his party steeld which once in him abated all the rest turnd on themselves like dull and heavy lead and as the thing thats heavy in itself upon enforcement flies with greatest speed so did our men heavy in hotspurs loss lend to this weight such lightness with their fear that arrows fled not swifter toward their aim than did our soldiers aiming at their safety fly from the field then was the noble worcester too soon taen prisoner and that furious scot the bloody douglas whose welllabouring sword had three times slain the appearance of the king gan vail his stomach and did grace the shame of those that turnd their backs and in his flight stumbling in fear was took the sum of all is that the king hath won and hath sent out a speedy power to encounter you my lord under the conduct of young lancaster and westmoreland this is the news at full the lives of all your loving complices lean on your health the which if you give oer to stormy passion must perforce decay you cast the event of war my noble lord and summd the account of chance before you said let us make head it was your presurmise that in the dole of blows your son might drop you knew he walkd oer perils on an edge more likely to fall in than to get oer you were advised his flesh was capable of wounds and scars and that his forward spirit would lift him where most trade of danger ranged yet did you say go forth and none of this though strongly apprehended could restrain the stiffborne action what hath then befallen or what hath this bold enterprise brought forth more than that being which was like to be tis more than time and my most noble lord i hear for certain and do speak the truth the gentle archbishop of york is up with wellappointed powers he is a man who with a double surety binds his followers my lord your son had only but the corpse but shadows and the shows of men to fight for that same word rebellion did divide the action of their bodies from their souls and they did fight with queasiness constraind as men drink potions that their weapons only seemd on our side but for their spirits and souls this word rebellion it had froze them up as fish are in a pond but now the bishop turns insurrection to religion supposed sincere and holy in his thoughts hes followed both with body and with mind and doth enlarge his rising with the blood of fair king richard scraped from pomfret stones derives from heaven his quarrel and his cause tells them he doth bestride a bleeding land gasping for life under great bolingbroke and more and less do flock to follow himsirrah you giant what says the doctor to my water men of all sorts take a pride to gird at me the brain of this foolishcompounded clay man is not able to invent anything that tends to laughter more than i invent or is invented on me i am not only witty in myself but the cause that wit is in other men i do here walk before thee like a sow that hath overwhelmed all her litter but one if the prince put thee into my service for any other reason than to set me off why then i have no judgment thou whoreson mandrake thou art fitter to be worn in my cap than to wait at my heels i was never manned with an agate till now but i will inset you neither in gold nor silver but in vile apparel and send you back again to your master for a jewel the juvenal the prince your master whose chin is not yet fledged i will sooner have a beard grow in the palm of my hand than he shall get one on his cheek and yet he will not stick to say his face is a faceroyal god may finish it when he will tis not a hair amiss yet he may keep it still at a faceroyal for a barber shall never earn sixpence out of it and yet hell be crowing as if he had writ man ever since his father was a bachelor he may keep his own grace but hes almost out of mine i can assure him what said master dombledon about the satin for my short cloak and my slops let him be damned like the glutton pray god his tongue be hotter a whoreson achitophel a rascally yeaforsooth knave to bear a gentleman in hand and then stand upon security the whoreson smoothpates do now wear nothing but high shoes and bunches of keys at their girdles and if a man is through with them in honest taking up then they must stand upon security i had as lief they would put ratsbane in my mouth as offer to stop it with security i looked a should have sent me two and twenty yards of satin as i am a true knight and he sends me security well he may sleep in security for he hath the horn of abundance and the lightness of his wife shines through it and yet cannot he see though he have his own lanthorn to light him wheres bardolph i bought him in pauls and hell buy me a horse in smithfield an i could get me but a wife in the stews i were manned horsed and wived wait close i will not see him lord chiefjusticewhats he that goes there boy tell him i am deaf what a young knave and begging is there not wars is there not employment doth not the king lack subjects do not the rebels need soldiers though it be a shame to be on any side but one it is worse shame to beg than to be on the worst side were it worse than the name of rebellion can tell how to make it why sir did i say you were an honest man setting my knighthood and my soldiership aside i had lied in my throat if i had said so i give thee leave to tell me so i lay aside that which grows to me if thou gettest any leave of me hang me if thou takest leave thou wert better be hanged you hunt counter hence avaunt my good lord god give your lordship good time of day i am glad to see your lordship

Henry V,o for a muse of fire that would ascend the brightest heaven of invention a kingdom for a stage princes to act and monarchs to behold the swelling scene then should the warlike harry like himself assume the port of mars and at his heels leashd in like hounds should famine sword and fire crouch for employment but pardon and gentles all the flat unraised spirits that have dared on this unworthy scaffold to bring forth so great an object can this cockpit hold the vasty fields of france or may we cram within this wooden o the very casques that did affright the air at agincourt o pardon since a crooked figure may attest in little place a million and let us ciphers to this great accompt on your imaginary forces work suppose within the girdle of these walls are now confined two mighty monarchies whose high upreared and abutting fronts the perilous narrow ocean parts asunder piece out our imperfections with your thoughts into a thousand parts divide on man and make imaginary puissance think when we talk of horses that you see them printing their proud hoofs i the receiving earth for tis your thoughts that now must deck our kings carry them here and there jumping oer times turning the accomplishment of many years into an hourglass for the which supply admit me chorus to this history who prologuelike your humble patience pray gently to hear kindly to judge our play now all the youth of england are on fire and silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies now thrive the armourers and honours thought reigns solely in the breast of every man they sell the pasture now to buy the horse following the mirror of all christian kings with winged heels as english mercuries for now sits expectation in the air and hides a sword from hilts unto the point with crowns imperial crowns and coronets promised to harry and his followers the french advised by good intelligence of this most dreadful preparation shake in their fear and with pale policy seek to divert the english purposes o england model to thy inward greatness like little body with a mighty heart what mightst thou do that honour would thee do were all thy children kind and natural but see thy fault france hath in thee found out a nest of hollow bosoms which he fills with treacherous crowns and three corrupted men one richard earl of cambridge and the second henry lord scroop of masham and the third sir thomas grey knight of northumberland have for the gilt of franceo guilt indeed confirmd conspiracy with fearful france and by their hands this grace of kings must die if hell and treason hold their promises ere he take ship for france and in southampton linger your patience on and well digest the abuse of distance force a play the sum is paid the traitors are agreed the king is set from london and the scene is now transported gentles to southampton there is the playhouse now there must you sit and thence to france shall we convey you safe and bring you back charming the narrow seas to give you gentle pass for if we may well not offend one stomach with our play but till the king come forth and not till then unto southampton do we shift our scene thus with imagined wing our swift scene flies in motion of no less celerity than that of thought suppose that you have seen the wellappointed king at hampton pier embark his royalty and his brave fleet with silken streamers the young phoebus fanning play with your fancies and in them behold upon the hempen tackle shipboys climbing hear the shrill whistle which doth order give to sounds confused behold the threaden sails borne with the invisible and creeping wind draw the huge bottoms through the furrowd sea breasting the lofty surge o do but think you stand upon the ravage and behold a city on the inconstant billows dancing for so appears this fleet majestical holding due course to harfleur follow follow grapple your minds to sternage of this navy and leave your england as dead midnight still guarded with grandsires babies and old women either past or not arrived to pith and puissance for who is he whose chin is but enrichd with one appearing hair that will not follow these culld and choicedrawn cavaliers to france work work your thoughts and therein see a siege behold the ordnance on their carriages with fatal mouths gaping on girded harfleur suppose the ambassador from the french comes back tells harry that the king doth offer him katharine his daughter and with her to dowry some petty and unprofitable dukedoms the offer likes not and the nimble gunner with linstock now the devilish cannon touches   and down goes all before them still be kind and eke out our performance with your mind now entertain conjecture of a time when creeping murmur and the poring dark fills the wide vessel of the universe from camp to camp through the foul womb of night the hum of either army stilly sounds that the fixed sentinels almost receive the secret whispers of each others watch fire answers fire and through their paly flames each battle sees the others umberd face steed threatens steed in high and boastful neighs piercing the nights dull ear and from the tents the armourers accomplishing the knights with busy hammers closing rivets up give dreadful note of preparation the country cocks do crow the clocks do toll and the third hour of drowsy morning name proud of their numbers and secure in soul the confident and overlusty french do the lowrated english play at dice and chide the cripple tardygaited night who like a foul and ugly witch doth limp so tediously away the poor condemned english like sacrifices by their watchful fires sit patiently and inly ruminate the mornings danger and their gesture sad investing lanklean cheeks and warworn coats presenteth them unto the gazing moon so many horrid ghosts o now who will behold the royal captain of this ruind band walking from watch to watch from tent to tent let him cry praise and glory on his head for forth he goes and visits all his host bids them good morrow with a modest smile and calls them brothers friends and countrymen upon his royal face there is no note how dread an army hath enrounded him nor doth he dedicate one jot of colour unto the weary and allwatched night but freshly looks and overbears attaint with cheerful semblance and sweet majesty that every wretch pining and pale before beholding him plucks comfort from his looks a largess universal like the sun his liberal eye doth give to every one thawing cold fear that mean and gentle all behold as may unworthiness define a little touch of harry in the night and so our scene must to the battle fly whereo for pitywe shall much disgrace with four or five most vile and ragged foils right illdisposed in brawl ridiculous the name of agincourt yet sit and see minding true things by what their mockeries be vouchsafe to those that have not read the story that i may prompt them and of such as have i humbly pray them to admit the excuse of time of numbers and due course of things which cannot in their huge and proper life be here presented now we bear the king toward calais grant him there there seen heave him away upon your winged thoughts athwart the sea behold the english beach pales in the flood with men with wives and boys whose shouts and claps outvoice the deep mouthd sea which like a mighty whiffler fore the king seems to prepare his way so let him land and solemnly see him set on to london so swift a pace hath thought that even now you may imagine him upon blackheath where that his lords desire him to have borne his bruised helmet and his bended sword before him through the city he forbids it being free from vainness and selfglorious pride giving full trophy signal and ostent quite from himself to god but now behold in the quick forge and workinghouse of thought how london doth pour out her citizens the mayor and all his brethren in best sort like to the senators of the antique rome with the plebeians swarming at their heels go forth and fetch their conquering caesar in as by a lower but loving likelihood were now the general of our gracious empress as in good time he may from ireland coming bringing rebellion broached on his sword how many would the peaceful city quit to welcome him much more and much more cause did they this harry now in london place him as yet the lamentation of the french invites the king of englands stay at home the emperors coming in behalf of france to order peace between them and omit all the occurrences whatever chanced till harrys backreturn again to france there must we bring him and myself have playd the interim by remembering you tis past then brook abridgment and your eyes advance after your thoughts straight back again to france thus far with rough and allunable pen our bending author hath pursued the story in little room confining mighty men mangling by starts the full course of their glory small time but in that small most greatly lived this star of england fortune made his sword by which the worlds best garden be achieved and of it left his son imperial lord henry the sixth in infant bands crownd king of france and england did this king succeed whose state so many had the managing that they lost france and made his england bleed which oft our stage hath shown and for their sake in your fair minds let this acceptance takemy lord ill tell you that self bill is urged which in the eleventh year of the last kings reign was like and had indeed against us passd but that the scambling and unquiet time did push it out of farther question it must be thought on if it pass against us we lose the better half of our possession for all the temporal lands which men devout by testament have given to the church would they strip from us being valued thus as much as would maintain to the kings honour full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights six thousand and two hundred good esquires and to relief of lazars and weak age of indigent faint souls past corporal toil a hundred almshouses right well supplied and to the coffers of the king beside a thousand pounds by the year thus runs the bill twould drink the cup and all the king is full of grace and fair regard the courses of his youth promised it not the breath no sooner left his fathers body but that his wildness mortified in him seemd to die too yea at that very moment consideration like an angel came and whippd the offending adam out of him leaving his body as a paradise to envelop and contain celestial spirits never was such a sudden scholar made never came reformation in a flood with such a heady currance scouring faults nor never hydraheaded wilfulness so soon did lose his seat and all at once as in this king hear him but reason in divinity and alladmiring with an inward wish you would desire the king were made a prelate hear him debate of commonwealth affairs you would say it hath been all in all his study list his discourse of war and you shall hear a fearful battle renderd you in music turn him to any cause of policy the gordian knot of it he will unloose familiar as his garter that when he speaks the air a charterd libertine is still and the mute wonder lurketh in mens ears to steal his sweet and honeyd sentences so that the art and practic part of life must be the mistress to this theoric which is a wonder how his grace should glean it since his addiction was to courses vain his companies unletterd rude and shallow his hours filld up with riots banquets sports and never noted in him any study any retirement any sequestration from open haunts and popularity it must be so for miracles are ceased and therefore we must needs admit the means how things are perfected he seems indifferent or rather swaying more upon our part than cherishing the exhibiters against us for i have made an offer to his majesty upon our spiritual convocation and in regard of causes now in hand which i have opend to his grace at large as touching france to give a greater sum than ever at one time the clergy yet did to his predecessors part withal with good acceptance of his majesty save that there was not time enough to hear as i perceived his grace would fain have done the severals and unhidden passages of his true titles to some certain dukedoms and generally to the crown and seat of france derived from edward his greatgrandfather the french ambassador upon that instant craved audience and the hour i think is come to give him hearing is it four oclock then go we in to know his embassy which i could with a ready guess declare before the frenchman speak a word of it god and his angels guard your sacred throne and make you long become it then hear me gracious sovereign and you peers that owe yourselves your lives and services to this imperial throne there is no bar to make against your highness claim to france but this which they produce from pharamond in terram salicam mulieres ne succedant no woman shall succeed in salique land which salique land the french unjustly gloze to be the realm of france and pharamond the founder of this law and female bar yet their own authors faithfully affirm that the land salique is in germany between the floods of sala and of elbe where charles the great having subdued the saxons there left behind and settled certain french who holding in disdain the german women for some dishonest manners of their life establishd then this law to wit no female should be inheritrix in salique land which salique as i said twixt elbe and sala is at this day in germany calld meisen then doth it well appear that salique law was not devised for the realm of france nor did the french possess the salique land until four hundred one and twenty years after defunction of king pharamond idly supposed the founder of this law who died within the year of our redemption four hundred twentysix and charles the great subdued the saxons and did seat the french beyond the river sala in the year eight hundred five besides their writers say king pepin which deposed childeric did as heir general being descended of blithild which was daughter to king clothair make claim and title to the crown of france hugh capet also who usurped the crown of charles the duke of lorraine sole heir male of the true line and stock of charles the great to find his title with some shows of truth through in pure truth it was corrupt and naught conveyd himself as heir to the lady lingare daughter to charlemain who was the son to lewis the emperor and lewis the son of charles the great also king lewis the tenth who was sole heir to the usurper capet could not keep quiet in his conscience wearing the crown of france till satisfied that fair queen isabel his grandmother was lineal of the lady ermengare daughter to charles the foresaid duke of lorraine by the which marriage the line of charles the great was reunited to the crown of france so that as clear as is the summers sun king pepins title and hugh capets claim king lewis his satisfaction all appear to hold in right and title of the female so do the kings of france unto this day howbeit they would hold up this salique law to bar your highness claiming from the female and rather choose to hide them in a net than amply to imbar their crooked titles usurpd from you and your progenitors the sin upon my head dread sovereign for in the book of numbers is it writ when the man dies let the inheritance descend unto the daughter gracious lord stand for your own unwind your bloody flag look back into your mighty ancestors go my dread lord to your greatgrandsires tomb from whom you claim invoke his warlike spirit and your greatuncles edward the black prince who on the french ground playd a tragedy making defeat on the full power of france whiles his most mighty father on a hill stood smiling to behold his lions whelp forage in blood of french nobility o noble english that could entertain with half their forces the full pride of france and let another half stand laughing by all out of work and cold for action o let their bodies follow my dear liege with blood and sword and fire to win your right in aid whereof we of the spiritualty will raise your highness such a mighty sum as never did the clergy at one time bring in to any of your ancestors they of those marches gracious sovereign shall be a wall sufficient to defend our inland from the pilfering borderers she hath been then more feard than harmd my liege for hear her but exampled by herself when all her chivalry hath been in france and she a mourning widow of her nobles she hath herself not only well defended but taken and impounded as a stray the king of scots whom she did send to france to fill king edwards fame with prisoner kings and make her chronicle as rich with praise as is the ooze and bottom of the sea with sunken wreck and sunless treasuries therefore doth heaven divide the state of man in divers functions setting endeavour in continual motion to which is fixed as an aim or butt obedience for so work the honeybees creatures that by a rule in nature teach the act of order to a peopled kingdom they have a king and officers of sorts where some like magistrates correct at home others like merchants venture trade abroad others like soldiers armed in their stings make boot upon the summers velvet buds which pillage they with merry march bring home to the tentroyal of their emperor who busied in his majesty surveys the singing masons building roofs of gold the civil citizens kneading up the honey the poor mechanic porters crowding in their heavy burdens at his narrow gate the sadeyed justice with his surly hum delivering oer to executors pale the lazy yawning drone i this infer that many things having full reference to one consent may work contrariously as many arrows loosed several ways come to one mark as many ways meet in one town as many fresh streams meet in one salt sea as many lines close in the dials centre so may a thousand actions once afoot end in one purpose and be all well borne without defeat therefore to france my liege divide your happy england into four whereof take you one quarter into france and you withal shall make all gallia shake if we with thrice such powers left at home cannot defend our own doors from the dog let us be worried and our nation lose the name of hardiness and policybut how my lord shall we resist it now this would drink deep but what prevention and a true lover of the holy church we are blessed in the change the strawberry grows underneath the nettle and wholesome berries thrive and ripen best neighbourd by fruit of baser quality and so the prince obscured his contemplation under the veil of wildness which no doubt grew like the summer grass fastest by night unseen yet crescive in his faculty but my good lord how now for mitigation of this bill urged by the commons doth his majesty incline to it or no how did this offer seem received my lord what was the impediment that broke this off it is ill wait upon you and i long to hear it awake remembrance of these valiant dead and with your puissant arm renew their feats you are their heir you sit upon their throne the blood and courage that renowned them runs in your veins and my thricepuissant liege is in the very maymorn of his youth ripe for exploits and mighty enterpriseswhere is my gracious lord of canterbury once more unto the breach dear friends once more or close the wall up with our english dead in peace theres nothing so becomes a man as modest stillness and humility but when the blast of war blows in our ears then imitate the action of the tiger stiffen the sinews summon up the blood disguise fair nature with hardfavourd rage then lend the eye a terrible aspect let pry through the portage of the head like the brass cannon let the brow oerwhelm it as fearfully as doth a galled rock oerhang and jutty his confounded base swilld with the wild and wasteful ocean now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide hold hard the breath and bend up every spirit to his full height on on you noblest english whose blood is fet from fathers of warproof fathers that like so many alexanders have in these parts from morn till even fought and sheathed their swords for lack of argument dishonour not your mothers now attest that those whom you calld fathers did beget you be copy now to men of grosser blood and teach them how to war and you good yeoman whose limbs were made in england show us here the mettle of your pasture let us swear that you are worth your breeding which i doubt not for there is none of you so mean and base that hath not noble lustre in your eyes i see you stand like greyhounds in the slips straining upon the start the games afoot follow your spirit and upon this charge cry god for harry england and saint georgenot here in presence your brother kings and monarchs of the earth do all expect that you should rouse yourself as did the former lions of your blood it follows then the cat must stay at home yet that is but a crushd necessity since we have locks to safeguard necessaries and pretty traps to catch the petty thieves while that the armed hand doth fight abroad the advised head defends itself at home for government though high and low and lower put into parts doth keep in one consent congreeing in a full and natural close like music tennisballs my liege this was a merry message they shall be apprehended by and by nay but the man that was his bedfellow whom he hath dulld and cloyd with gracious favours that he should for a foreign purse so sell his sovereigns life to death and treachery i arrest thee of high treason by the name of richard earl of cambridge i arrest thee of high treason by the name of henry lord scroop of masham i arrest thee of high treason by the name of thomas grey knight of northumberland from him and thus he greets your majesty he wills you in the name of god almighty that you divest yourself and lay apart the borrowd glories that by gift of heaven by law of nature and of nations long to him and to his heirs namely the crown and all widestretched honours that pertain by custom and the ordinance of times unto the crown of france that you may know tis no sinister nor no awkward claim pickd from the wormholes of longvanishd days nor from the dust of old oblivion raked he sends you this most memorable line in every branch truly demonstrative willing to overlook this pedigree and when you find him evenly derived from his most famed of famous ancestors edward the third he bids you then resign your crown and kingdom indirectly held from him the native and true challenger bloody constraint for if you hide the crown even in your hearts there will he rake for it therefore in fierce tempest is he coming in thunder and in earthquake like a jove that if requiring fail he will compel and bids you in the bowels of the lord deliver up the crown and to take mercy on the poor souls for whom this hungry war opens his vasty jaws and on your head turning the widows tears the orphans cries the dead mens blood the pining maidens groans for husbands fathers and betrothed lovers that shall be swallowd in this controversy this is his claim his threatening and my message unless the dauphin be in presence here to whom expressly i bring greeting too scorn and defiance slight regard contempt and any thing that may not misbecome the mighty sender doth he prize you at thus says my king an if your fathers highness do not in grant of all demands at large sweeten the bitter mock you sent his majesty hell call you to so hot an answer of it that caves and womby vaultages of france shall chide your trespass and return your mock in second accent of his ordnance hell make your paris louvre shake for it were it the mistresscourt of mighty europe and be assured youll find a difference as we his subjects have in wonder found between the promise of his greener days and these he masters now now he weighs time even to the utmost grain that you shall read in your own losses if he stay in france dispatch us with all speed lest that our king come here himself to question our delay for he is footed in this land already theres five to one besides they all are fresh farewell kind lord fight valiantly today and yet i do thee wrong to mind thee of it for thou art framed of the firm truth of valour the duke of york commends him to your majesty in which array brave soldier doth he lie larding the plain and by his bloody side yokefellow to his honourowing wounds the noble earl of suffolk also lies suffolk first died and york all haggled over comes to him where in gore he lay insteepd and takes him by the beard kisses the gashes that bloodily did spawn upon his face and cries aloud tarry dear cousin suffolk my soul shall thine keep company to heaven tarry sweet soul for mine then fly abreast as in this glorious and wellfoughten field we kept together in our chivalry upon these words i came and cheerd him up he smiled me in the face raught me his hand and with a feeble gripe says dear my lord commend my service to me sovereign so did he turn and over suffolks neck he threw his wounded arm and kissd his lips and so espoused to death with blood he seald a testament of nobleending love the pretty and sweet manner of it forced those waters from me which i would have stoppd but i had not so much of man in me and all my mother came into mine eyes and gave me up to tears here comes the herald of the french my liege soldier you must come to the king charles duke of orleans nephew to the king john duke of bourbon and lord bouciqualt of other lords and barons knights and squires full fifteen hundred besides common men tis wonderful only he hath not yet subscribed this where your majesty demands that the king of france having any occasion to write for matter of grant shall name your highness in this form and with this addition in french notre trescher fils henri roi dangleterre heritier de france and thus in latin praeclarissimus filius noster henricus rex angliae et haeres franciaesend for him good uncle how yet resolves the governor of the town this is the latest parle we will admit therefore to our best mercy give yourselves or like to men proud of destruction defy us to our worst for as i am a soldier a name that in my thoughts becomes me best if i begin the battery once again i will not leave the halfachieved harfleur till in her ashes she lie buried the gates of mercy shall be all shut up and the fleshd soldier rough and hard of heart in liberty of bloody hand shall range with conscience wide as hell mowing like grass your freshfair virgins and your flowering infants what is it then to me if impious war arrayd in flames like to the prince of fiends do with his smirchd complexion all fell feats enlinkd to waste and desolation what ist to me when you yourselves are cause if your pure maidens fall into the hand of hot and forcing violation what rein can hold licentious wickedness when down the hill he holds his fierce career we may as bootless spend our vain command upon the enraged soldiers in their spoil as send precepts to the leviathan to come ashore therefore you men of harfleur take pity of your town and of your people whiles yet my soldiers are in my command whiles yet the cool and temperate wind of grace oerblows the filthy and contagious clouds of heady murder spoil and villany if not why in a moment look to see the blind and bloody soldier with foul hand defile the locks of your shrillshrieking daughters your fathers taken by the silver beards and their most reverend heads dashd to the walls your naked infants spitted upon pikes whiles the mad mothers with their howls confused do break the clouds as did the wives of jewry at herods bloodyhunting slaughtermen what say you will you yield and this avoid or guilty in defence be thus destroyd unfold it godamercy old heart thou speakst cheerfully i am a gentleman of a company yes do not you wear your dagger in your cap that day lest he knock that about yours and his kinsman too though it appear a little out of fashion there is much care and valour in this welshman if i live to see it i will never trust his word after praised be god and not our strength for it what is this castle calld that stands hard by then keep thy vow sirrah when thou meetest the fellow knowest thou gower how now whats the matter now herald are the dead numberd come go we in procession to the village and be it death proclaimed through our host to boast of this or take the praise from god which is his only yes captain but with this acknowledgement that god fought for us fair katharine and most fair will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms such as will enter at a ladys ear and plead his lovesuit to her gentle heart can any of your neighbours tell kate ill ask them come i know thou lovest me and at night when you come into your closet youll question this gentlewoman about me and i know kate you will to her dispraise those parts in me that you love with your heart but good kate mock me mercifully the rather gentle princess because i love thee cruelly if ever thou beest mine kate as i have a saving faith within me tells me thou shalt i get thee with scambling and thou must therefore needs prove a good soldierbreeder shall not thou and i between saint denis and saint george compound a boy half french half english that shall go to constantinople and take the turk by the beard shall we not what sayest thou my fair flowerdeluce no tis hereafter to know but now to promise do but now promise kate you will endeavour for your french part of such a boy and for my english moiety take the word of a king and a bachelor how answer you la plus belle katharine du monde mon tres cher et devin deesse o kate nice customs curtsy to great kings dear kate you and i cannot be confined within the weak list of a countrys fashion we are the makers of manners kate and the liberty that follows our places stops the mouth of all findfaults as i will do yours for upholding the nice fashion of your country in denying me a kiss therefore patiently and yielding   you have witchcraft in your lips kate there is more eloquence in a sugar touch of them than in the tongues of the french council and they should sooner persuade harry of england than a general petition of monarchs here comes your father i would have her learn my fair cousin how perfectly i love her and that is good english our tongue is rough coz and my condition is not smooth so that having neither the voice nor the heart of flattery about me i cannot so conjure up the spirit of love in her that he will appear in his true likeness yet they do wink and yield as love is blind and enforces then good my lord teach your cousin to consent winking i am content so the maiden cities you talk of may wait on her so the maid that stood in the way for my wish shall show me the way to my willshall we call in the ambassador my liege they know your grace hath cause and means and might so hath your highness never king of england had nobles richer and more loyal subjects whose hearts

able verbatim to rehearse the method of my pen no prelate such is thy audacious wickedness thy lewd pestiferous and dissentious pranks as very infants prattle of thy pride thou art a most pernicious usurer forward by nature enemy to peace lascivious wanton more than well beseems a man of thy profession and degree and for thy treachery whats more manifest in that thou laidst a trap to take my life as well at london bridge as at the tower beside i fear me if thy thoughts were sifted the king thy sovereign is not quite exempt from envious malice of thy swelling heart bishop as good thou bastard of my grandfather bishop am i not protector saucy priest bishop yes as an outlaw in a castle keeps and useth it to patronage his theft bishop thou art reverent touching thy spiritual function not thy life bishop you of my household leave this peevish broil and set this unaccustomd fight aside third servingmanmy lord we know your grace to be a man just and upright and for your royal birth inferior to none but to his majesty and ere that we will suffer such a prince so kind a father of the commonweal to be disgraced by an inkhorn mate we and our wives and children all will fight and have our bodies slaughtered by thy foes first servingmanay and the very parings of our nails shall pitch a field when we are dead stay stay i say and if you love me as you say you do let me persuade you to forbear awhile compassion on the king commands me stoop or i would see his heart out ere the priest should ever get that privilege of me here winchester i offer thee my hand aside  ay but i fear me with a hollow heart see here my friends and loving countrymen this token serveth for a flag of truce betwixt ourselves and all our followers so help me god as i dissemble not bishop well urged my lord of warwick or sweet prince and if your grace mark every circumstance you have great reason to do richard right especially for those occasions at eltham place i told your majesty now will it best avail your majesty to cross the seas and to be crownd in france the presence of a king engenders love amongst his subjects and his loyal friends as it disanimates his enemies your ships already are in readiness yes if it please your majesty my liege lord bishop set the crown upon his head bishop now governor of paris take your oath that you elect no other king but him esteem none friends but such as are his friends and none your foes but such as shall pretend malicious practises against his state this shall ye do so help you righteous god to say the truth this fact was infamous and ill beseeming any common man much more a knight a captain and a leader what means his grace that he hath changed his style no more but plain and bluntly to the king hath he forgot he is his sovereign or doth this churlish superscription pretend some alteration in good will whats here   i have upon especial cause moved with compassion of my countrys wreck together with the pitiful complaints of such as your oppression feeds upon forsaken your pernicious faction and joind with charles the rightful king of france o monstrous treachery can this be so that in alliance amity and oaths there should be found such false dissembling guile he doth my lord and is become your foe it is the worst and all my lord he writes confirm it so confounded be your strife and perish ye with your audacious prate presumptuous vassals are you not ashamed with this immodest clamorous outrage to trouble and disturb the king and us and you my lords methinks you do not well to bear with their perverse objections much less to take occasion from their mouths to raise a mutiny betwixt yourselves let me persuade you take a better course i have my lord and their intent is this they humbly sue unto your excellence to have a godly peace concluded of between the realms of england and of france well my good lord and as the only means to stop effusion of our christian blood and stablish quietness on every side beside my lord the sooner to effect and surer bind this knot of amity the earl of armagnac near knit to charles a man of great authority in france proffers his only daughter to your grace in marriage with a large and sumptuous dowry and for the proffer of my lord your master i have informd his highness so at large as liking of the ladys virtuous gifts her beauty and the value of her dower he doth intend she shall be englands queen so should i give consent to flatter sin you know my lord your highness is betrothd unto another lady of esteem how shall we then dispense with that contract and not deface your honour with reproach why what i pray is margaret more than that her father is no better than an earl although in glorious titles he excel and so the earl of armagnac may do because he is near kinsman unto charles ay grief i fear me both at first and lastwe mourn in black why mourn we not in blood henry is dead and never shall revive upon a wooden coffin we attend and deaths dishonourable victory we with our stately presence glorify like captives bound to a triumphant car what shall we curse the planets of mishap that plotted thus our glorys overthrow or shall we think the subtlewitted french conjurers and sorcerers that afraid of him by magic verses have contrived his end bishop how were they lost what treachery was used were our tears wanting to this funeral these tidings would call forth their flowing tides the dauphin crowned king all fly to him o whither shall we fly from this reproach remember lords your oaths to henry sworn either to quell the dauphin utterly or bring him in obedience to your yoke to eltham will i where the young king is being ordaind his special governor and for his safety there ill best devise   bishop ay we may march in england or in france not seeing what is likely to ensue this late dissension grown betwixt the peers burns under feigned ashes of forged love and will at last break out into a flame as festerd members rot but by degree till bones and flesh and sinews fall away so will this base and envious discord breed and now i fear that fatal prophecy which in the time of henry named the fifth was in the mouth of every sucking babe that henry born at monmouth should win all and henry born at windsor lose all which is so plain that exeter doth wish his days may finish ere that hapless time it grieves his highness good my lords be friends well didst thou richard to suppress thy voice for had the passions of thy heart burst out i fear we should have seen decipherd there more rancorous spite more furious raging broils than yet can be imagined or supposed but howsoeer no simple man that sees this jarring discord of nobility this shouldering of each other in the court this factious bandying of their favourites but that it doth presage some ill event tis much when sceptres are in childrens hands but more when envy breeds unkind division there comes the rain there begins confusion what is my lord of winchester installd and calld unto a cardinals degree then i perceive that will be verified henry the fifth did sometime prophesy if once he come to be a cardinal hell make his cap coequal with the crown beside his wealth doth warrant a liberal dower where reignier sooner will receive than givehe was a king blessd of the king of kings unto the french the dreadful judgementday so dreadful will not be as was his sight the battles of the lord of hosts he fought the churchs prayers made him so prosperous each hath his place and function to attend i am left out for me nothing remains but long i will not be jack out of office the king from eltham i intend to steal and sit at chiefest stern of public weal how now ambitious humphry what means this i do thou most usurping proditor and not protector of the king or realm nay stand thou back i will not budge a foot this be damascus be thou cursed cain to slay thy brother abel if thou wilt heres gloucester a foe to citizens one that still motions war and never peace oercharging your free purses with large fines that seeks to overthrow religion because he is protector of the realm and would have armour here out of the tower to crown himself king and suppress the prince comest thou with deep premeditated lines with written pamphlets studiously devised humphrey of gloucester if thou canst accuse or aught intendst to lay unto my charge do it without invention suddenly as i with sudden and extemporal speech purpose to answer what thou canst object ay lordly sir for what are you i pray but one imperious in anothers throne unreverent gloster well duke of gloucester i will yield to thee love for thy love and hand for hand i give god save king henry of that name the sixth stay my lord legate you shall first receive the sum of money which i promised should be deliverd to his holiness for clothing me in these grave ornaments lord regent i do greet your excellence with letters of commission from the king for know my lords the states of christendom moved with remorse of these outrageous broils have earnestly implored a general peace betwixt our nation and the aspiring french and here at hand the dauphin and his train approacheth to confer about some matter charles and the rest it is enacted thus that in regard king henry gives consent of mere compassion and of lenity to ease your country of distressful war and suffer you to breathe in fruitful peace you shall become true liegemen to his crown and charles upon condition thou wilt swear to pay him tribute submit thyself thou shalt be placed as viceroy under him and still enjoy thy regal dignitygloucester whateer we like thou art protector and lookest to command the prince and realm thy wife is proud she holdeth thee in awe more than god or religious churchmen may what wherein talbot overcame ist so do what thou darest i beard thee to thy face gloucester thou wilt answer this before the pope gloucester we will meet to thy cost be sure thy heartblood i will have for this days work abominable gloucester guard thy head for i intend to have it ere long gloucester i do defy thee lords vouchsafe to give me hearing what i shall reply if i were covetous ambitious or perverse as he will have me how am i so poor or how haps it i seek not to advance or raise myself but keep my wonted calling and for dissension who preferreth peace more than i doexcept i be provoked no my good lords it is not that offends it is not that that hath incensed the duke it is because no one should sway but he no one but he should be about the king and that engenders thunder in his breast and makes him roar these accusations forth but he shall know i am as good and am not i a prelate of the church rome shall remedy this he shall submit or i will never yield aside  so help me god as i intend it not as will the rest so willeth winchester aside  now winchester will not submit i trow or be inferior to the proudest peer humphrey of gloucester thou shalt well perceive that neither in birth or for authority the bishop will be overborne by thee ill either make thee stoop and bend thy knee or sack this country with a mutinymy honourable lords health to you all sad tidings bring i to you out of france of loss of slaughter and discomfiture guienne champagne rheims orleans paris guysors poictiers are all quite lost no treachery but want of men and money amongst the soldiers this is muttered that here you maintain several factions and whilst a field should be dispatchd and fought you are disputing of your generals one would have lingering wars

lords to add to your laments wherewith you now bedew king henrys hearse i must inform you of a dismal fight betwixt the stout lord talbot and the french bishop o no wherein lord talbot was oerthrown the circumstance ill tell you more at large the tenth of august last this dreadful lord retiring from the siege of orleans having full scarce six thousand in his troop by three and twenty thousand of the french was round encompassed and set upon no leisure had he to enrank his men he wanted pikes to set before his archers instead whereof sharp stakes pluckd out of hedges they pitched in the ground confusedly to keep the horsemen off from breaking in more than three hours the fight continued where valiant talbot above human thought enacted wonders with his sword and lance hundreds he sent to hell and none durst stand him here there and every where enraged he flew the french exclaimd the devil was in arms all the whole army stood agazed on him his soldiers spying his undaunted spirit a talbot a talbot cried out amain and rushd into the bowels of the battle here had the conquest fully been seald up if sir john fastolfe had not playd the coward he being in the vaward placed behind with purpose to relieve and follow them cowardly fled not having struck one stroke hence grew the general wreck and massacre enclosed were they with their enemies a base walloon to win the dauphins grace thrust talbot with a spear into the back whom all france with their chief assembled strength durst not presume to look once in the face o no he lives but is took prisoner and lord scales with him and lord hungerford most of the rest slaughterd or took likewise so you had need for orleans is besieged the english army is grown weak and faint the earl of salisbury craveth supply and hardly keeps his men from mutiny since they so few watch such a multitude my lord my lord the french have gathered head the dauphin with one joan la pucelle joind a holy prophetess new risen up is come with a great power to raise the siege all hail my lords which of this princely train call ye the warlike talbot for his acts so much applauded through the realm of france the virtuous lady countess of

now we are victors upon us he smiles what towns of any moment but we have at pleasure here we lie near orleans otherwhiles the famishd english like pale ghosts faintly besiege us one hour in a month sound sound alarum we will rush on them now for the honour of the forlorn french him i forgive my death that killeth me when he sees me go back one foot or fly who ever saw the like what men have i dogs cowards dastards i would neer have fled but that they left me midst my enemies lets leave this town for they are harebraind slaves and hunger will enforce them to be more eager of old i know them rather with their teeth the walls theyll tear down than forsake the siege bastard of orleans thrice welcome to us go call her in   but first to try her skill reignier stand thou as dauphin in my place question her proudly let thy looks be stern by this means shall we sound what skill she hath thou hast astonishd me with thy high terms only this proof ill of thy valour make in single combat thou shalt buckle with me and if thou vanquishest thy words are true otherwise i renounce all confidence then come o gods name i fear no woman stay stay thy hands thou art an amazon and fightest with the sword of deborah whoeer helps thee tis thou that must help me impatiently i burn with thy desire my heart and hands thou hast at once subdued excellent pucelle if thy name be so let me thy servant and

won for which i will divide my crown with her and all the priests and friars in my realm shall in procession sing her endless praise a statelier pyramis to her ill rear than rhodopes or memphis ever

denis will we cry but joan la pucelle shall be frances saint come in and let us banquet royally after this golden day of victory is this thy cunning thou deceitful dame didst thou at first to flatter us withal make us partakers of a little gain that now our loss might be ten times so much duke of alencon this was your default that being captain of the watch tonight did look no better to that weighty charge and for myself most part of all this night within her quarter and mine own precinct i was employd in passing to and fro about relieving of the sentinels then how or which way should they first break in saint denis bless this happy stratagem and once again well sleep secure in rouen now shine it like a comet of revenge a prophet to the fall of all our foes your grace may starve perhaps before that time we have been guided by thee hitherto and of thy cunning had no diffidence one sudden foil shall never breed distrust ay marry sweeting if we could do that france were no place for henrys warriors nor should that nation boast it so with us but be extirped from our provinces a parley with the duke of burgundy speak pucelle and enchant him with thy words welcome brave duke thy friendship makes us fresh now let us on my lords and join our powers and seek how we may prejudice the foe had york and somerset brought rescue in we should have found a bloody day of this o no forbear for that which we have fled during the life let us not wrong it dead on what submissive message art thou sent for prisoners askst thou hell our prison is but tell me whom thou seekst go take their bodies hence so we be rid of them do with em what thou wilt and now to paris in this conquering vein all will be ours now bloody talbots slain these news my lord may cheer our drooping spirits tis said the stout parisians do revolt and turn again unto the warlike french what tidings send our scouts i prithee speak somewhat too sudden sirs the warning is but we will presently provide for them then on my lords and france be fortunate since lords of england it is thus agreed that peaceful truce shall be proclaimd in france we come to be informed by yourselves what the conditions of that league must be tis known already that i am possessd with more than half the gallian territories and therein reverenced for their lawful king shall i for lucre of the rest unvanquishd detract so much from that prerogative as to be calld but viceroy of the whole no lord ambassador ill rather keep that which i have than coveting for more be cast from possibility of all it shall only reserved you claim no interest in any of our towns of garrisonthey want their porridge and their fat bullbeeves either they must be dieted like mules and have their provender tied to their mouths or piteous they

samsons and goliases it sendeth forth to skirmish one to ten lean rawboned rascals who would eer suppose they had such courage and audacity be it so doubtless he shrives this woman to her smock else neer could he so long protract his speech he may mean more than we poor men do know these women are shrewd tempters with their tongues leave off delays and let us raise the siege all france will be replete with mirth and joy when they shall hear how we have playd the men how now my lords what all unready so of all exploits since first i followd arms neer heard i of a warlike enterprise more venturous or desperate than this here cometh charles i marvel how he sped had all your quarters been as safely kept as that whereof i had the government we had not been thus shamefully surprised signior no well set thy statue in some holy place and have thee reverenced like a blessed saint employ thee then sweet virgin for our good for ever should they be expulsed from france and not have title of an earldom here pucelle hath bravely playd her part in this and doth deserve a coronet of gold then march to paris royal charles of france and keep not back your powers in dalliance must he be then as shadow of himself adorn his temples with a coronet and yet in substance and authority retain but privilege of a private man this proffer is absurd and reasonless to say the truth it is your policy to save your subjects from such massacre and ruthless slaughters as are daily seen by our proceeding in hostility and therefore take this compact of a truce although you break it when your pleasure serveslets raise the siege why live we idly here talbot is taken whom we wont to fear remaineth none but madbraind salisbury and he may well in fretting spend his gall nor men nor money hath he to make war salisbury is a desperate homicide he fighteth as one weary of his life the other lords like lions wanting food do rush upon us as their hungry prey i think by some odd gimmors or device their arms are set like clocks stiff to strike on else neer could they hold out so as they do by my consent well even let them alone fair maid ist thou wilt do these wondrous feats she takes upon her bravely at first dash my lord methinks is very long in talk shall we disturb him since he keeps no mean my lord where are you what devise you on shall we give over orleans or no woman do what thou

into this duke and had i first been put to speak my mind i think i should have told your graces tale the duchess by his subornation upon my life began her devilish practises or if he were not privy to those faults yet by reputing of his high descent as next the king he was successive heir and such high vaunts of his nobility did instigate the bedlam brainsick duchess by wicked means to frame our sovereigns fall smooth runs the water where the brook is deep and in his simple show he harbours treason the fox barks not when he would steal the lamb no no my sovereign gloucester is a man unsounded yet and full of deep deceit nay gloucester know that thou art come too soon unless thou wert more loyal than thou art i do arrest thee of high treason here my lord these faults are easy quickly answered but mightier crimes are laid unto your charge whereof you cannot easily purge yourself i do arrest you in his highness name and here commit you to my lord cardinal to keep until your further time of trial hath he not twit our sovereign lady here with ignominious words though clerkly couchd as if she had suborned some to swear false allegations to oerthrow his state but in my mind that were no policy the king will labour still to save his life the commons haply rise to save his life and yet we have but trivial argument more than mistrust that shows him worthy death ah york no man alive so fain as i madam tis true and weret not madness then to make the fox surveyor of the fold who being accused a crafty murderer his guilt should be but idly posted over because his purpose is not executed no let him die in that he is a fox by nature proved an enemy to the flock before his chaps be staind with crimson blood as humphrey proved by reasons to my liege and do not stand on quillets how to slay him be it by gins by snares by subtlety sleeping or waking tis no matter how so he be dead for that is good deceit which mates him first that first intends deceit not resolute except so much were done for things are often spoke and seldom meant but that my heart accordeth with my tongue seeing the deed is meritorious and to preserve my sovereign from his foe say but the word and i will be his priest here is my hand the deed is worthy doing why our authority is his consent and what we do establish he confirms then noble york take thou this task in hand a charge lord york that i will see performd but now return we to the false duke humphrey ill see it truly done my lord of york now sirs have you dispatchd this thing why thats well said go get you to my house i

lord warwick for his vow why warwick who should do the duke to death myself and beaufort had him in protection and we i hope sir are no murderers i wear no knife to slaughter sleeping men but heres a vengeful sword rusted with ease that shall be scoured in his rancorous heart that slanders me with murders crimson badge say if thou darest proud lord of warwickshire that i am faulty in duke humphreys death bluntwitted lord ignoble in demeanor if ever lady wrongd her lord so much thy mother took into her blameful bed some stern untutord churl and noble stock was graft with crabtree slip whose fruit thou art and never of the nevils noble race thou shall be waking well i shed thy blood if from this presence thou darest go with me the traitorous warwick with the men of bury set all upon me mighty sovereign tis like the commons rude unpolishd hinds could send such message to their sovereign but you my lord were glad to be employd to show how quaint an orator you are but all the honour salisbury hath won is that he was the lord ambassador sent from a sort of tinkers to the king cease gentle queen these execrations and let thy suffolk take his heavy leave a plague upon them wherefore should i curse them would curses kill as doth the mandrakes groan i would invent as bittersearching terms as curst as harsh and horrible to hear deliverd strongly through my fixed teeth with full as many signs of deadly hate as leanfaced envy in her loathsome cave my tongue should stumble in mine earnest words mine eyes should sparkle like the beaten flint mine hair be fixed on end as one distract ay every joint should seem to curse and ban and even now my burthend heart would break should i not curse them poison be their drink gall worse than gall the daintiest that they taste their sweetest shade a grove of cypress trees their chiefest prospect murdering basilisks their softest touch as smart as lizards sting their music frightful as the serpents hiss and boding screechowls make the concert full all the foul terrors in darkseated hell you bade me ban and will you bid me leave now by the ground that i am banishd from well could i curse away a winters night though standing naked on a mountain top where biting cold would never let grass grow and think it but a minute spent in sport thus is poor suffolk ten times banished once by the king and three times thrice by thee tis not the land i care for wert thou thence a wilderness is populous enough so suffolk had thy heavenly company for where thou art there is the world itself with every several pleasure in the world and where thou art not desolation i can no more live thou to joy thy life myself no joy in nought but that thou livest if i depart from thee i cannot live and in thy sight to die what were it else but like a pleasant slumber in thy lap here could i breathe my soul into the air as mild and gentle as the cradlebabe dying with mothers dug between its lips where from thy sight i should be raging mad and cry out for thee to close up mine eyes to have thee with thy lips to stop my mouth so shouldst thou either turn my flying soul or i should breathe it so into thy body and then it lived in sweet elysium to die by thee were but to die in jest from thee to die were torture more than death o let me stay befall what may befall i go a jewel lockd into the wofullst cask that ever did contain a thing of worth even as a splitted bark so sunder we this way fall i to death look on my george i am a gentleman rate me at what thou wilt thou shalt be paid thy name affrights me in whose sound is

feard thy faith what louring star now envies thy estate that these great lords and margaret our queen do seek subversion of thy harmless life thou never didst them wrong nor no man wrong and as the butcher takes away the calf and binds the wretch and beats it when it strays bearing it to the bloody slaughterhouse even so remorseless have they borne him hence and as the dam runs lowing up and

suffolk comfort me came he right now to sing a ravens note whose dismal tune bereft my vital powers and thinks he that the chirping of a wren by crying comfort from a hollow breast can chase away the firstconceived sound hide not thy poison with such sugard words lay not thy hands on me forbear i say their touch affrights me as a serpents sting thou baleful messenger out of my sight upon thy eyeballs murderous tyranny sits in grim majesty to fright the world look not upon me for thine eyes are wounding yet do not go away come basilisk and kill the innocent gazer with thy sight for in the shade of death i shall find joy in life but double death now gloucesters dead ah woe is me for gloucester wretched man that he is dead good warwick tis too true but how he died god knows not henry enter his chamber view his breathless corpse and comment then upon his sudden death o thou that judgest all things stay my thoughts my thoughts that labour to persuade my soul some violent hands were laid on humphreys life if my suspect be false forgive me god for judgment only doth belong to thee fain would i go to chafe his paly lips with twenty thousand kisses and to drain upon his face an ocean of salt tears to tell my love unto his dumb deaf trunk and with my fingers feel his hand unfeeling but all in vain are these mean obsequies and to survey his dead and earthly image what were it but to make my sorrow greater that is to see how deep my grave is made for with his soul fled all my worldly solace for seeing him i see my life in death why how now lords your wrathful weapons drawn here in our presence dare you be so bold why what tumultuous clamour have we here go salisbury and tell them all from me i thank them for their tender loving care and had i not been cited so by them yet did i purpose as they do entreat for sure my thoughts do hourly prophesy mischance unto my state by suffolks means and therefore by his majesty i swear whose far unworthy deputy i am he shall not breathe infection in this air but three days longer on the pain of death ungentle queen to call him gentle suffolk no more i say if thou dost plead for him thou wilt but add increase unto my wrath had i but said i would have kept my word but when i swear it is irrevocable if after three days space thou here best found on any ground that i am ruler of the world shall not be ransom for thy life come warwick come good warwick go with me i have great matters to impart to thee how fares my lord speak beaufort to thy sovereign ah what a sign it is of evil life where deaths approach is seen so terrible o thou eternal mover of the heavens look with a gentle eye upon this wretch o beat away the busy meddling fiend that lays strong siege unto this wretchs soul and from his bosom purge this black despair peace to his soul if gods good pleasure be lord cardinal if thou thinkst on heavens bliss hold up thy hand make signal of thy hope he dies and makes no sign o god forgive him forbear to judge for we are sinners all close up his eyes and draw the curtain close and let us all to meditation lord say jack cade hath sworn to have thy head how now madam still lamenting and mourning for suffolks death i fear me love if that i had been dead thou wouldst not have mournd so much for me o graceless men they know not what they do lord say the traitors hate thee therefore away with us to killingworth come margaret god our hope will succor us farewell my lord trust not the kentish rebels why buckingham is the traitor cade surprised or is he but retired to make him strong then heaven set ope thy everlasting gates to entertain my vows of thanks and praise soldiers this day have you redeemed your lives and showd how well you love your prince and country continue still in this so good a mind and henry though he be infortunate assure yourselves will never be unkind and so with thanks and pardon to you all i do dismiss you to your several countries thus stands my state twixt cade and york distressd like to a ship that having scaped a tempest is straightway calmd and boarded with a pirate but now is cade driven back his men dispersed and now is york in arms to second him i pray thee buckingham go and meet him and ask him whats the reason of these arms tell him ill send duke edmund to the tower and somerset well commit thee thither until his army be dismissd from him in any case be not too rough in terms for he is fierce and cannot brook hard language come wife lets in and learn to govern better for yet may england curse my wretched reign buckingham doth york intend no harm to us that thus he marcheth with thee arm in arm then what intends these forces thou dost bring the head of cade great god how just art thou o let me view his visage being dead that living wrought me such exceeding trouble tell me my friend art thou the man that slew him how art thou calld and what is thy degree iden kneel down   rise up a knight we give thee for reward a thousand marks and will that thou henceforth attend on us see buckingham somerset comes with the queen go bid her hide him quickly from the duke ay clifford a bedlam and ambitious humour makes him oppose himself against his king why warwick hath thy knee forgot to bow old salisbury shame to thy silver hair thou mad misleader of thy brainsick son what wilt thou on thy deathbed play the ruffian and seek for sorrow with thy spectacles o where is faith o where is loyalty if it be banishd from the frosty head where shall it find a harbour in the earth wilt thou go dig a grave to find out war and shame thine honourable age with blood why art thou old and wantst experience or wherefore dost abuse it if thou hast it for shame in duty bend thy knee to me that bows unto the grave with mickle age hast thou not sworn allegiance unto me canst thou dispense with heaven for such an oath call buckingham and bid him arm himself can we outrun the heavens good margaret staygreat king of england and my gracious lord the mutual conference that my mind hath had by day by night waking and in my dreams in courtly company or at my beads with you mine alderliefest sovereign makes me the bolder to salute my king with ruder terms such as my wit affords and overjoy of heart doth minister reading  to my lord protector are your supplications to his lordship let me see them what is thine my lord of suffolk say is this the guise is this the fashion in the court of england is this the government of britains isle and this the royalty of albions king what shall king henry be a pupil still under the surly gloucesters governance am i a queen in title and in style and must be made a subject to a duke i tell thee pole when in the city tours thou ranst a tilt in honour of my love and stolest away the ladies hearts of france i thought king henry had resembled thee in courage courtship and proportion but all his mind is bent to holiness to number avemaries on his beads his champions are the prophets and apostles his weapons holy saws of sacred writ his study is his tiltyard and his loves are brazen images of canonized saints i would the college of the cardinals would choose him pope and carry him to rome and set the triple crown upon his head that were a state fit for his holiness because the king forsooth will have it so if he be old enough what needs your grace to be protector of his excellence and thy ambition gloucester tell me good fellow camest thou here by chance or of devotion to this holy shrine it made me laugh to see the villain run gloucester see here the tainture of thy nest and look thyself be faultless thou wert best why now is henry king and margaret queen and humphrey duke of gloucester scarce himself that bears so shrewd a maim two pulls at once his lady banishd and a limb loppd off this staff of honour raught there let it stand where it best fits to be in henrys hand ay good my lord for purposely therefore left i the court to see this quarrel tried can you not see or will ye not observe the strangeness of his alterd countenance with what a majesty he bears himself how insolent of late he is become how proud how peremptory and unlike himself we know the time since he was mild and affable and if we did but glance a faroff look immediately he was upon his knee that all the court admired him for submission but meet him now and be it in the morn when every one will give the time of day he knits his brow and shows an angry eye and passeth by with stiff unbowed knee disdaining duty that to us belongs small curs are not regarded when they grin but great men tremble when the lion roars and humphrey is no little man in england first note that he is near you in descent and should you fall he as the next will mount me seemeth then it is no policy respecting what a rancorous mind he bears and his advantage following your decease that he should come about your royal person or be admitted to your highness council by flattery hath he won the commons hearts and when he please to make commotion tis to be feard they all will follow him now tis the spring and weeds are shallowrooted suffer them now and theyll oergrow the garden and choke the herbs for want of husbandry the reverent care i bear unto my lord made me collect these dangers in the duke if it be fond call it a womans fear which fear if better reasons can supplant i will subscribe and say i wrongd the duke my lord of suffolk buckingham and york reprove my allegation if you can or else conclude my words effectual ah whats more dangerous than this fond affiance seems he a dove his feathers are but borrowed for hes disposed as the hateful raven is he a lamb his skin is surely lent him for hes inclined as is the ravenous wolf who cannot steal a shape that means deceit take heed my lord the welfare of us all hangs on the cutting short that fraudful man but i can give the loser leave to chide what will your highness leave the parliament free lords cold snow melts with the suns hot beams henry my lord is cold in great affairs too full of foolish pity and gloucesters show beguiles him as the mournful crocodile with sorrow snares relenting passengers or as the snake rolld in a flowering bank with shining chequerd slough doth sting a child that for the beauty thinks it excellent believe me lords were none more wise than i and yet herein i judge mine own wit good this gloucester should be quickly rid the world to rid us of the fear we have of him so the poor chicken should be sure of death and so say i nay then this spark will prove a raging fire if wind and fuel be brought to feed it with no more good york sweet somerset be still thy fortune york hadst thou been regent there might happily have proved far worse than his god forbid any malice should prevail that faultless may condemn a nobleman pray god he may acquit him of suspicion marry god forfend run go help help o henry ope thine eyes why do you rate my lord of suffolk thus although the duke was enemy to him yet he most christianlike laments his death and for myself foe as he was to me might liquid tears or heartoffending groans or bloodconsuming sighs recall his life i would be blind with weeping sick with groans look pale as primrose with blooddrinking sighs and all to have the noble duke alive what know i how the world may deem of me for it is known we were but hollow friends it may be judged i made the duke away so shall my name with slanders tongue be wounded and princes courts be filld with my reproach this get i by his death ay me unhappy to be a queen and crownd with infamy be woe for me more wretched than he is what dost thou turn away and hide thy face i am no loathsome leper look on me what art thou like the adder waxen deaf be poisonous too and kill thy forlorn queen is all thy comfort shut in gloucesters tomb why then dame margaret was neer thy joy erect his statue and worship it and make my image but an alehouse sign was i for this nigh wreckd upon the sea and twice by awkward wind from englands bank drove back again unto my native clime what boded this but well forewarning wind did seem to say seek not a scorpions nest nor set no footing on this unkind shore what did i then but cursed the gentle gusts and he that loosed them forth their brazen caves and bid them blow towards englands blessed shore or turn our stern upon a dreadful rock yet aeolus would not be a murderer but left that hateful office unto thee the prettyvaulting sea refused to drown me knowing that thou wouldst have me drownd on shore with tears as salt as sea through thy unkindness the splitting rocks cowerd in the sinking sands and would not dash me with their ragged sides because thy flinty heart more hard than they might in thy palace perish margaret as far as i could ken thy chalky cliffs when from thy shore the tempest beat us back i stood upon the hatches in the storm and when the dusky sky began to rob my earnestgaping sight of thy lands view i took a costly jewel from my neck a heart it was bound in with diamonds and threw it towards thy land the sea received it and so i wishd thy body might my heart and even with this i lost fair englands view and bid mine eyes be packing with my heart and calld them blind and dusky spectacles for losing ken of albions wished coast how often have i tempted suffolks tongue the agent of thy foul inconstancy to sit and witch me as ascanius did when he to madding dido would unfold his fathers acts commenced in burning troy am i not witchd like her or thou not false like him ay me i can no more die margaret for henry weeps that thou dost live so long then you belike suspect these noblemen as guilty of duke humphreys timeless death are you the butcher suffolk wheres your knife is beaufort termd a kite where are his talons he dares not calm his contumelious spirit nor cease to be an arrogant controller though suffolk dare him twenty thousand times fie coward woman and softhearted wretch hast thou not spirit to curse thine enemy enough sweet suffolk thou tormentst thyself and these dread curses like the sun gainst glass or like an overcharged gun recoil and turn the force of them upon thyself o let me entreat thee cease give me thy hand that i may dew it with my mournful tears nor let the rain of heaven wet this place to wash away my woful monuments o could this kiss be printed in thy hand that thou mightst think upon these by the seal through whom a thousand sighs are breathed for thee so get thee gone that i may know my grief tis but surmised whiles thou art standing by as one that surfeits thinking on a want i will repeal thee or be well assured adventure to be banished myself and banished i am if but from thee go speak not to me even now be gone o go not yet even thus two friends condemnd embrace and kiss and take ten thousand leaves loather a hundred times to part than die yet now farewell and farewell life with thee and take my heart with thee this way for me oft have i heard that grief softens the mind and makes it fearful and degenerate think therefore on revenge and cease to weep but who can cease to weep and look on this here may his head lie on my throbbing breast but wheres the body that i should embrace ah barbarous villains hath this lovely face ruled like a wandering planet over me and could it not enforce them to relent that were unworthy to behold the same ah were the duke of suffolk now alive these kentish rebels would be soon appeased my hope is gone now suffolk is deceased for thousand yorks he shall not hide his head but boldly stand and front him to his face and here comes clifford to deny their bail he is arrested but will not obey his sons he says shall give their words for him a subtle traitor needs no sophister away my lord you are slow for sham,History,21
Henry VI part 3,i wonder how the king escaped our hands and so do i victorious prince of york before i see thee seated in that throne which now the house of lancaster usurps i vow by heaven these eyes shall never close this is the palace of the fearful king and this the regal seat possess it york for this is thine and not king henrys heirs and when the king comes offer no violence unless he seek to thrust you out perforce the bloody parliament shall this be calld unless plantagenet duke of york be king and bashful henry deposed whose cowardice hath made us bywords to our enemies neither the king nor he that loves him best the proudest he that holds up lancaster dares stir a wing if warwick shake his bells ill plant plantagenet root him up who dares resolve thee richard claim the english crown exeter thou art a traitor to the crown in following this usurping henry true clifford and thats richard duke of york be duke of lancaster let him be king and warwick shall disprove it you forget that we are those which chased you from the field and slew your fathers and with colours spread marchd through the city to the palace gates poor clifford how i scorn his worthless threats talk not of france sith thou hast lost it all plantagenet shall speak first hear him lords and be you silent and attentive too for he that interrupts him shall not live prove it henry and thou shalt be king suppose my lords he did it unconstraind think you twere prejudicial to his crown deposed he shall be in despite of all do right unto this princely duke of york or i will fill the house with armed men and over the chair of state where now he sits write up his title with usurping blood what good is this to england and himself turn this way henry and regard them not why should you sigh my lord long live king henry plantagenet embrace him and ill keep london with my soldiers how now fair lords what fare what news abroad ten days ago i drownd these news in tears and now to add more measure to your woes i come to tell you things sith then befalln after the bloody fray at wakefield fought where your brave father breathed his latest gasp tidings as swiftly as the posts could run were brought me of your loss and his depart i then in london keeper of the king musterd my soldiers gatherd flocks of friends and very well appointed as i thought marchd toward saint albans to intercept the queen bearing the king in my behalf along for by my scouts i was advertised that she was coming with a full intent to dash our late decree in parliament touching king henrys oath and your succession short tale to make we at saint albans met our battles joind and both sides fiercely fought but whether twas the coldness of the king who lookd full gently on his warlike queen that robbd my soldiers of their heated spleen or whether twas report of her success or more than common fear of cliffords rigour who thunders to his captives blood and death i cannot judge but to conclude with truth their weapons like to lightning came and went our soldiers like the nightowls lazy flight or like an idle thresher with a flail fell gently down as if they struck their friends i cheerd them up with justice of our cause with promise of high pay and great rewards but all in vain they had no heart to fight and we in them no hope to win the day so that we fled the king unto the queen lord george your brother norfolk and myself in haste posthaste are come to join with you for in the marches here we heard you were making another head to fight again some six miles off the duke is with the soldiers and for your brother he was lately sent from your kind aunt duchess of burgundy with aid of soldiers to this needful war nor now my scandal richard dost thou hear for thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine can pluck the diadem from faint henrys head and wring the awful sceptre from his fist were he as famous and as bold in war as he is famed for mildness peace and prayer why therefore warwick came to seek you out and therefore comes my brother montague attend me lords the proud insulting queen with clifford and the haught northumberland and of their feather many more proud birds have wrought the easymelting king like wax he swore consent to your succession his oath enrolled in the parliament and now to london all the crew are gone to frustrate both his oath and what beside may make against the house of lancaster their power i think is thirty thousand strong now if the help of norfolk and myself with all the friends that thou brave earl of march amongst the loving welshmen canst procure will but amount to five and twenty thousand why via to london will we march amain and once again bestride our foaming steeds and once again cry charge upon our foes but never once again turn back and fly no longer earl of march but duke of york the next degree is englands royal throne for king of england shalt thou be proclaimd in every borough as we pass along and he that throws not up his cap for joy shall for the fault make forfeit of his head king edward valiant richard montague stay we no longer dreaming of renown but sound the trumpets and about our task how now what news why then it sorts brave warriors lets away what sayst thou henry wilt thou yield the crown then twas my turn to fly and now tis thine twas not your valour clifford drove me thence if thou deny their blood upon thy head for york in justice puts his armour on forspent with toil as runners with a race i lay me down a little while to breathe for strokes received and many blows repaid have robbd my strongknit sinews of their strength and spite of spite needs must i rest awhile how now my lord what hap what hope of good then let the earth be drunken with our blood ill kill my horse because i will not fly why stand we like softhearted women here wailing our losses whiles the foe doth rage and look upon as if the tragedy were playd in jest by counterfeiting actors here on my knee i vow to god above ill never pause again never stand still till either death hath closed these eyes of mine or fortune given me measure of revenge away away once more sweet lords farewell no tis impossible he should escape for though before his face i speak the words your brother richard markd him for the grave and wheresoeer he is hes surely dead from off the gates of york fetch down the head your fathers head which clifford placed there instead whereof let this supply the room measure for measure must be answered i think his understanding is bereft speak clifford dost thou know who speaks to thee dark cloudy death oershades his beams of life and he nor sees nor hears us what we say clifford devise excuses for thy faults they mock thee clifford swear as thou wast wont ay but hes dead off with the traitors head and rear it in the place your fathers stands and now to london with triumphant march there to be crowned englands royal king from whence shall warwick cut the sea to france and ask the lady bona for thy queen so shalt thou sinew both these lands together and having france thy friend thou shalt not dread the scatterd foe that hopes to rise again for though they cannot greatly sting to hurt yet look to have them buzz to offend thine ears first will i see the coronation and then to brittany ill cross the sea to effect this marriage so it please my lord tut thats a foolish observation richard be duke of gloucester now to london to see these honours in possession from worthy edward king of albion my lord and sovereign and thy vowed friend i come in kindness and unfeigned love first to do greetings to thy royal person and then to crave a league of amity and lastly to confirm that amity with a nuptial knot if thou vouchsafe to grant that virtuous lady bona thy fair sister to englands king in lawful marriage to bona  and gracious madam in our kings behalf i am commanded with your leave and favour humbly to kiss your hand and with my tongue to tell the passion of my sovereigns heart where fame late entering at his heedful ears hath placed thy beautys image and thy virtue injurious margaret because thy father henry did usurp and thou no more are prince than she is queen oxford how haps it in this smooth discourse you told not how henry the sixth hath lost all that which henry fifth had gotten methinks these peers of france should smile at that but for the rest you tell a pedigree of threescore and two years a silly time to make prescription for a kingdoms worth can oxford that did ever fence the right now buckler falsehood with a pedigree for shame leave henry and call edward king and i the house of york thereon i pawn my credit and mine honour the more that henry was unfortunate such it seems as may beseem a monarch like himself myself have often heard him say and swear that this his love was an eternal plant whereof the root was fixd in virtues ground the leaves and fruit maintaind with beautys sun exempt from envy but not from disdain unless the lady bona quit his pain henry now lives in scotland at his ease where having nothing nothing can he lose and as for you yourself our quondam queen you have a father able to maintain you and better twere you troubled him than france mine full of sorrow and hearts discontent king lewis i here protest in sight of heaven and by the hope i have of heavenly bliss that i am clear from this misdeed of edwards no more my king for he dishonours me but most himself if he could see his shame did i forget that by the house of york my father came untimely to his death did i let pass the abuse done to my niece did i impale him with the regal crown did i put henry from his native right and am i guerdond at the last with shame shame on himself for my desert is honour and to repair my honour lost for him i here renounce him and return to henry my noble queen let former grudges pass and henceforth i am thy true servitor i will revenge his wrong to lady bona and replant henry in his former state so much his friend ay his unfeigned friend that if king lewis vouchsafe to furnish us with some few bands of chosen soldiers ill undertake to land them on our coast and force the tyrant from his seat by war tis not his newmade bride shall succor him and as for clarence as my letters tell me hes very likely now to fall from him for matching more for wanton lust than honour or than for strength and safety of our country and mine fair lady bona joins with yours tell him from me that he hath done me wrong and therefore ill uncrown him eret be long theres thy reward be gone this shall assure my constant loyalty that if our queen and this young prince agree ill join mine eldest daughter and my joy to him forthwith in holy wedlock bands i came from edward as ambassador but i return his sworn and mortal foe matter of marriage was the charge he gave me but dreadful war shall answer his demand had he none else to make a stale but me then none but i shall turn his jest to sorrow i was the chief that raised him to the crown and ill be chief to bring him down again not that i pity henrys misery but seek revenge on edwards mockery trust me my lord all hitherto goes well the common people by numbers swarm to us   but see where somerset and clarence come speak suddenly my lords are we all friends then gentle clarence welcome unto warwick and welcome somerset i hold it cowardice to rest mistrustful where a noble heart hath pawnd an open hand in sign of love else might i think that clarence edwards brother were but a feigned friend to our proceedings but welcome sweet clarence my daughter shall be thine and now what rests but in nights coverture thy brother being carelessly encampd his soldiers lurking in the towns about and but attended by a simple guard we may surprise and take him at our pleasure our scouts have found the adventure very easy that as ulysses and stout diomede with sleight and manhood stole to rhesus tents and brought from thence the thracian fatal steeds so we well coverd with the nights black mantle at unawares may beat down edwards guard and seize himself i say not slaughter him for i intend but only to surprise him you that will follow me to this attempt applaud the name of henry with your leader   why then lets on our way in silent sort for warwick and his friends god and saint george this is his tent and see where stand his guard courage my masters honour now or never but follow me and edward shall be ours richard and hastings let them go here is the duke ay but the case is alterd when you disgraced me in my embassade then i degraded you from being king and come now to create you duke of york alas how should you govern any kingdom that know not how to use ambassadors nor how to be contented with one wife nor how to use your brothers brotherly nor how to study for the peoples welfare nor how to shroud yourself from enemies then for his mind be edward englands king   but henry now shall wear the english crown and be true king indeed thou but the shadow my lord of somerset at my request see that forthwith duke edward be conveyd unto my brother archbishop of york when i have fought with pembroke and his fellows ill follow you and tell what answer lewis and the lady bona send to him now for a while farewell good duke of york ay thats the first thing that we have to do to free king henry from imprisonment and see him seated in the regal throne your grace hath still been famed for virtuous and now may seem as wise as virtuous by spying and avoiding fortunes malice for few men rightly temper with the stars yet in this one thing let me blame your grace for choosing me when clarence is in place and i choose clarence only for protector what answers clarence to his sovereigns will why then though loath yet must i be content well yoke together like a double shadow to henrys body and supply his place i mean in bearing weight of government while he enjoys the honour and his ease and clarence now then it is more than needful forthwith that edward be pronounced a traitor and all his lands and goods be confiscate ay therein clarence shall not want his part what news my friend unsavoury news but how made he escape my brother was too careless of his charge but let us hence my sovereign to provide a salve for any sore that may betide what counsel lords edward from belgia with hasty germans and blunt hollanders hath passd in safety through the narrow seas and with his troops doth march amain to london and many giddy people flock to him in warwickshire i have truehearted friends not mutinous in peace yet bold in war those will i muster up and thou son clarence shalt stir up in suffolk norfolk and in kent the knights and gentlemen to come with thee thou brother montague in buckingham northampton and in leicestershire shalt find men well inclined to hear what thou commandst and thou brave oxford wondrous well beloved in oxfordshire shalt muster up thy friends

for so great a weight and weakling warwick takes his gift again and henry is my king warwick his subject i had rather chop this hand off at a blow and with the other fling it at thy face than bear so low a sail to strike to thee o cheerful colours see where oxford comes o welcome oxford for we want thy help and lo where george of clarence sweeps along of force enough to bid his brother battle with whom an upright zeal to right prevails more than the nature of a brothers love come clarence come thou wilt if warwick call o passing traitor perjured and unjust alas i am not coopd here for defence i will away towards barnet presently and bid thee battle edward if thou darest ah who is nigh come to me friend or foe and tell me who is victor york or warwick why ask i that my mangled body shows my blood my want of strength my sick heart shows that i must yield my body to the earth and by my fall the conquest to my foe thus yields the cedar to the axes edge whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle under whose shade the ramping lion slept whose topbranch overpeerd joves spreading tree and kept low shrubs from winters powerful wind these eyes that now are dimmd with deaths black veil have been as piercing as the midday sun to search the secret treasons of the world the wrinkles in my brows now filled with blood were likend oft to kingly sepulchres for who lived king but i could dig his grave and who durst mine when warwick bent his brow lo now my glory smeard in dust and blood my parks my walks my manors that i had even now forsake me and of all my lands is nothing

thou shalt reign in quiet while thou livest this oath i willingly take and will perform now york and lancaster are reconciled farewell my gracious lord ill to my castle why how now sons and brother at a strife what is your quarrel how began it first about what mine boy not till king henry be dead i took an oath that he should quietly reign i shall be if i claim by open war thou canst not son it is

intent you edward shall unto my lord cobham with whom the kentishmen will willingly rise in them i trust for they are soldiers witty courteous liberal full of spirit while you are thus employd what resteth more but that i seek occasion how to rise and yet the king not privy to my drift nor any of the house of lancaster   but stay what news why comest thou in such post ay with my sword what thinkst thou that we fear them edward and richard you shall stay with me my brother montague shall post to london let noble warwick cobham and the rest whom we have left protectors of the king with powerful policy strengthen themselves and trust not simple henry nor his oaths what with five thousand men five men to twenty though the odds be great i doubt not uncle of our victory many a battle have i won in france when as the enemy hath been ten to one why should i not now have the like success the army of the queen hath got the field my uncles both are slain in rescuing me and all my followers to the eager foe turn back and fly like ships before the wind or lambs pursued by hungerstarved wolves my sons god knows what hath bechanced them but this i know they have demeand themselves like men born to renown by life or death three times did richard make a lane to me and thrice cried courage father fight it out and full as oft came edward to my side with purple falchion painted to the hilt in blood of those that had encounterd him and when the hardiest warriors did retire richard cried charge and give no foot of ground and cried a crown or else a glorious tomb a sceptre or an earthly sepulchre with this we charged again but out alas we bodged again as i have seen a swan with bootless labour swim against the tide and spend her strength with overmatching waves   ah hark the fatal followers do pursue and i am faint and cannot fly their fury and were i strong i would not shun their fury the sands are numberd that make up my life here must i stay and here my life must end   come bloody clifford rough northumberland i dare your quenchless fury to more rage i am your butt and i abide your shot my ashes as the phoenix may bring forth a bird that will revenge upon you all and in that hope i throw mine eyes to heaven scorning whateer you can afflict me with why come you not what multitudes and fear o clifford but bethink thee once again and in thy thought oerrun my former time and if though canst for blushing view this face and bite thy tongue that slanders him with cowardice whose frown hath made thee faint and fly ere this so triumph thieves upon their conquerd booty so true men yield with robbers so oermatchd shewolf of france but worse than wolves of france whose tongue more poisons than the adders tooth how illbeseeming is it in thy sex to triumph like an amazonian trull upon their woes whom fortune captivates but that thy face is vizardlike unchanging made impudent with use of evil deeds i would assay proud queen to make thee blush to tell thee whence thou camest of whom derived were shame enough to shame thee wert thou not shameless thy father bears the type of king of naples of both the sicils and jerusalem yet not so wealthy as an english yeoman hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult it needs not nor it boots thee not proud queen unless the adage must be verified that beggars mounted run their horse to death tis beauty that doth oft make women proud but god he knows thy share thereof is small tis virtue that doth make them most admired the contrary doth make thee wonderd at tis government that makes them seem divine the want thereof makes thee abominable thou art as opposite to every good as the antipodes are unto us or as the south to the septentrion o tigers heart wrapt in a womans hide how couldst thou drain the lifeblood of the child to bid the father wipe his eyes withal and yet be seen to bear a womans face women are soft mild pitiful and flexible thou stern obdurate flinty rough remorseless bidst thou me rage why now thou hast thy wish wouldst have me weep why now thou hast thy will for raging wind blows up incessant showers and when the rage allays the rain begins these tears are my sweet rutlands obsequies and every drop cries vengeance for his death gainst thee fell clifford and thee false frenchwoman that face of his the hungry cannibals would not have touchd would not have staind with blood but you are more inhuman more inexorable o ten times more than tigers of hyrcania see ruthless queen a hapless fathers tears this cloth thou dipdst in blood of my sweet boy and i with tears do wash the blood away keep thou the napkin and go boast of this and if thou tellst the heavy story right upon my soul the hearers will shed tears yea even my foes will shed fastfalling tears and say alas it was a piteous deed there take the crown and with the crown my curse and in thy need such comfort come to thee as now i reap at thy too cruel hand hardhearted clifford take me from the world my soul to heaven my blood upon your heads open thy gate of mercy gracious god my soul flies through these wounds to seek out theelord staffords father duke of buckingham is either slain or wounded dangerously i cleft his beaver with a downright blow that this is true father behold his blood sweet father do so set it on your head no i can better play the orator no quarrel but a slight contention now you are heir therefore enjoy it now by giving the house of lancaster leave to breathe it will outrun you father in the end but for a kingdom any oath may be broken i would break a thousand oaths to reign one year i hear their drums lets set our men in order and issue forth and bid them battle straight i wonder how our princely father scaped or whether he be scaped away or no from cliffords and northumberlands pursuit had he been taen we should have heard the news had he been slain we should have heard the news or had he scaped methinks we should have heard the happy tidings of his good escape how fares my brother why is he so sad dazzle mine eyes or do i see three suns tis wondrous strange the like yet never heard of i think it cites us brother to the field that we the sons of brave plantagenet each one already blazing by our meeds should notwithstanding join our lights together and overshine the earth as this the world whateer it bodes henceforward will i bear upon my target three fairshining suns o speak no more for i have heard too much sweet duke of york our prop to lean upon now thou art gone we have no staff no stay o clifford boisterous clifford thou hast slain the flower of europe for his chivalry and treacherously hast thou vanquishd him for hand to hand he would have vanquishd thee now my souls palace is become a prison ah would she break from hence that this my body might in the ground be closed up in rest for never henceforth shall i joy again never o never shall i see more joy his name that valiant duke hath left with thee his dukedom and his chair with me is left o warwick warwick that plantagenet which held three dearly as his souls redemption is by the stern lord clifford done to death where is the duke of norfolk gentle warwick and when came george from burgundy to england lord warwick on thy shoulder will i lean and when thou failstas god forbid the hour must edward fall which peril heaven forfend then strike up drums god and saint george for us now perjured henry wilt thou kneel for grace and set thy diadem upon my head or bide the mortal fortune of the field i am his king and he should bow his knee i was adopted heir by his consent since when his oath is broke for as i hear you that are king though he do wear the crown have caused him by new act of parliament to blot out me and put his own son in say henry shall i have my right or no a thousand men have broke their fasts today that neer shall dine unless thou yield the crown a wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns to make this shameless callet know herself helen of greece was fairer far than thou although thy husband may be menelaus and neer was agamemnons brother wrongd by that false woman as this king by thee his father revelld in the heart of france and tamed the king and made the dauphin stoop and had he matchd according to his state he might have kept that glory to this day but when he took a beggar to his bed and graced thy poor sire with his bridalday even then that sunshine brewd a shower for him that washd his fathers fortunes forth of france and heapd sedition on his crown at home for what hath broachd this tumult but thy pride hadst thou been meek our title still had slept and we in pity of the gentle king had slippd our claim until another age and in this resolution i defy thee not willing any longer conference since thou deniest the gentle king to speak sound trumpets let our bloody colours wave and either victory or else a grave no wrangling woman well no longer stay these words will cost ten thousand lives this day smile gentle heaven or strike ungentle death for this world frowns and edwards sun is clouded bootless is flight they follow us with wings and weak we are and cannot shun pursuit o warwick i do bend my knee with thine and in this vow do chain my soul to thine and ere my knee rise from the earths cold face i throw my hands mine eyes my heart to thee thou setter up and plucker down of kings beseeching thee if with they will it stands that to my foes this body must be prey yet that thy brazen gates of heaven may ope and give sweet passage to my sinful soul now lords take leave until we meet again whereer it be in heaven or in earth now breathe we lords good fortune bids us pause and smooth the frowns of war with peaceful looks some troops pursue the bloodyminded queen that led calm henry though he were a king as doth a sail filld with a fretting gust command an argosy to stem the waves but think you lords that clifford fled with them whose soul is that which takes her heavy leave see who it is and now the battles ended if friend or foe let him be gently used bring forth that fatal screechowl to our house that nothing sung but death to us and ours now death shall stop his dismal threatening sound and his illboding tongue no more shall speak clifford repent in bootless penitence thou pitiedst rutland i will pity thee even as thou wilt sweet warwick let it be for in thy shoulder do i build my seat and never will i undertake the thing wherein thy counsel and consent is wanting richard i will create thee duke of gloucester and george of clarence warwick as ourself shall do and undo as him pleaseth best and why not queen tis even so yet you are warwick stilland brother heres the earl of wiltshires blood whom i encounterd as the battles joind good brother as thou lovest and honourest arms lets fight it out and not stand cavilling thus and i unto the sea from whence i came but i have reasons strong and forcible brother i go ill win them fear it not and thus most humbly i do take my leave     sir john and sir hugh mortimer mine uncles you are come to sandal in a happy hour the army of the queen mean to besiege us yet to have joind with france in such alliance would more have strengthend this our commonwealth gainst foreign storms than any homebred marriage but the safer when tis backd with france so god help montague as he proves true to help king edward in his time of storm as every loyal subject ought to do then fare you well for i will hence again i came to serve a king and not a duke drummer strike up and let us march away what talk you of debating in few words if youll not here proclaim yourself our king ill leave you to your fortune and be gone to keep them back that come to succor you why shall we fight if you pretend no title ay now my sovereign speaketh like himself and now will i be edwards champion and whosoeer gainsays king edwards right by this i challenge him to single fight comfort my lord and so i take my leave montague montague for lancasterspeak thou for me and tell them what i did thus do i hope to shake king henrys head armd as we are lets stay within this house you are old enough now and yet methinks you lose father tear the crown from the usurpers head sound drums and trumpets and the king will fly brother though i be youngest give me leave about that which concerns your grace and us the crown of england father which is yours your right depends not on his life or death no god forbid your grace should be forsworn ill prove the contrary if youll hear me speak an oath is of no moment being not took before a true and lawful magistrate that hath authority over him that swears henry had none but did usurp the place then seeing twas he that made you to depose your oath my lord is vain and frivolous therefore to arms and father do but think how sweet a thing it is to wear a crown within whose circuit is elysium and all that poets feign of bliss and joy why do we finger thus i cannot rest until the white rose that i wear be dyed eve,History,22
Henry VIII,good morrow and well met how have ye done since last we saw in france an untimely ague stayd me a prisoner in my chamber when those suns of glory those two lights of men met in the vale of andren all the whole time i was my chambers prisoner o you go far who did guide i mean who set the body and the limbs of this great sport together as you guess i pray you who my lord the devil speed him no mans pie is freed from his ambitious finger what had he to do in these fierce vanities i wonder that such a keech can with his very bulk take up the rays o the beneficial sun and keep it from the earth why the devil upon this french going out took he upon him without the privity o the king to appoint who should attend on him he makes up the file of all the gentry for the most part such to whom as great a charge as little honour he meant to lay upon and his own letter the honourable board of council out must fetch him in the papers o many have broke their backs with laying manors on em for this great journey what did this vanity but minister communication of a most poor issue every man after the hideous storm that followd was a thing inspired and not consulting broke into a general prophecy that this tempest dashing the garment of this peace aboded the sudden breach ont why all this business our reverend cardinal carried this butchers cur is venommouthd and i have not the power to muzzle him therefore best not wake him in his slumber a beggars book outworths a nobles blood i read ins looks matter against me and his eye reviled me as his abject object at this instant he bores me with some trick hes gone to the king ill follow and outstare him ill to the king and from a mouth of honour quite cry down this ipswich fellows insolence or proclaim theres difference in no persons sir i am thankful to you and ill go along by your prescription but this topproud fellow whom from the flow of gall i name not but from sincere motions by intelligence and proofs as clear as founts in july when we see each grain of gravel i do know to be corrupt and treasonous to the king ill sayt and make my vouch as strong as shore of rock attend this holy fox or wolf or bothfor he is equal ravenous as he is subtle and as prone to mischief as able to performt his mind and place infecting one another yea reciprocally only to show his pomp as well in france as here at home suggests the king our master to this last costly treaty the interview that swallowd so much treasure and like a glass did break i the rinsing pray give me favour sir this cunning cardinal the articles o the combination drew as himself pleased and they were ratified as he cried thus let be to as much end as give a crutch to the dead but our countcardinal has done this and tis well for worthy wolsey who cannot err he did it now this follows which as i take it is a kind of puppy to the old dam treasoncharles the emperor under pretence to see the queen his aunt for twas indeed his colour but he came to whisper wolseyhere makes visitation his fears were that the interview betwixt england and france might through their amity breed him some prejudice for from this league peepd harms that menaced him he privily deals with our cardinal and as i trow which i do well for i am sure the emperor paid ere he promised whereby his suit was granted ere it was askd but when the way was made and paved with gold the emperor thus desired that he would please to alter the kings course and break the foresaid peace let the king know as soon he shall by me that thus the cardinal does buy and sell his honour as he pleases and for his own advantage no not a syllable i do pronounce him in that very shape he shall appear in proof lo you my lord the net has falln upon me i shall perish under device and practise it will help me nothing to plead mine innocence for that dye is on me which makes my whitest part black the will of heaven be done in this and all things i obey o my lord abergavenny fare you well so so these are the limbs o the plot no more i hope o nicholas hopkins my surveyor is false the oergreat cardinal hath showd him gold my life is spannd already i am the shadow of poor buckingham whose figure even this instant cloud puts on by darkening my clear sun my lord farewell all good people you that thus far have come to pity me hear what i say and then go home and lose me i have this day received a traitors judgment and by that name must die yet heaven bear witness and if i have a co nscience let it sink me even as the axe falls if i be not faithful the law i bear no malice for my death t has done upon the premises but justice but those that sought it i could wish more christians be what they will i heartily forgive em yet let em look they glory not in mischief nor build their evils on the graves of great men for then my guiltless blood must cry against em for further life in this world i neer hope nor will i sue although the king have mercies more than i dare make faults you few that loved me and dare be bold to weep for buckingham his noble friends and fellows whom to leave is only bitter to him only dying go with me like good angels to my end and as the long divorce of steel falls on me make of your prayers one sweet sacrifice and lift my soul to heaven lead on o gods name sir thomas lovell i as free forgive you as i would be forgiven i forgive all there cannot be those numberless offences gainst me that i cannot take peace with no black envy shall mark my grave commend me to his grace and if he speak of buckingham pray tell him you met him half in heaven my vows and prayers yet are the kings and till my soul forsake shall cry for blessings on him may he live longer than i have time to tell his years ever beloved and loving may his rule be and when old time shall lead him to his end goodness and he fill up one monument nay sir nicholas let it alone my state now will but mock me when i came hither i was lord high constable and duke of buckingham now poor edward bohun yet i am richer than my base accusers that never knew what truth meant i now seal it and with that blood will make em one day groan fort my noble father henry of buckingham who first raised head against usurping richard flying for succor to his servant banister being distressd was by that wretch betrayd and without trial fell gods peace be with him henry the seventh succeeding truly pitying my fathers loss like a most royal prince restored me to my honours and out of ruins made my name once more noble now his son henry the eighth life honour name and all that made me happy at one stroke has taken for ever from the world i had my trial and must needs say a noble one which makes me a little happier than my wretched father yet thus far we are one in fortunes both fell by our servants by those men we loved most a most unnatural and faithless service heaven has an end in all yet you that hear me this from a dying man receive as certain where you are liberal of your loves and counsels be sure you be not loose for those you make friends and give your hearts to when they once perceive the least rub in your fortunes fall away like water from ye never found again but where they mean to sink ye all good people pray for me i must now forsake ye the last hour of my long weary life is come upon me farewell and when you would say something that is sad speak how i fell i have done and god forgive mei thank your grace healthful and ever since a fresh admirer of what i saw there twixt guynes and arde i was then present saw them salute on horseback beheld them when they lighted how they clung in their embracement as they grew together which had they what four throned ones could have weighd such a compounded one then you lost the view of earthly glory men might say till this time pomp was single but now married to one above itself each following day became the next days master till the last made former wonders its today the french all clinquant all in gold like heathen gods shone down the english and tomorrow they made britain india every man that stood showd like a mine their dwarfish pages were as cherubins all guilt the madams too not used to toil did almost sweat to bear the pride upon them that their very labour was to them as a painting now this masque was cried incomparable and the ensuing night made it a fool and beggar the two kings equal in lustre were now best now worst as presence did present them him in eye still him in praise and being present both twas said they saw but one and no discerner durst wag his tongue in censure when these suns for so they phrase emby their heralds challenged the noble spirits to arms they did perform beyond thoughts compass that former fabulous story being now seen possible enough got credit that bevis was believed as i belong to worship and affect in honour honesty the tract of every thing would by a good discourser lose some life which actions self was tongue to all was royal to the disposing of it nought rebelld order gave each thing view the office did distinctly his full function one certes that promises no element in such a business all this was orderd by the good discretion of the right reverend cardinal of york surely sir theres in him stuff that puts him to these ends for being not proppd by ancestry whose grace chalks successors their way nor calld upon for high feats done to the crown neither allied for eminent assistants but spiderlike out of his selfdrawing web he gives us note the force of his own merit makes his way a gift that heaven gives for him which buys a place next to the king grievingly i think the peace between the french and us not values the cost that did conclude it which is budded out for france hath flawd the league and hath attachd our merchants goods at bourdeaux marry ist like it your grace the state takes notice of the private difference betwixt you and the cardinal i advise you and take it from a heart that wishes towards you honour and plenteous safetythat you read the cardinals malice and his potency together to consider further that what his high hatred would effect wants not a minister in his power you know his nature that hes revengeful and i know his sword hath a sharp edge its long and t may be said it reaches far and where twill not extend thither he darts it bosom up my counsel youll find it wholesome lo where comes that rock that i advise your shunning what are you chafed ask god for temperance thats the appliance only which your disease requires stay my lord and let your reason with your choler question what tis you go about to climb steep hills requires slow pace at first anger is like a fullhot horse who being allowd his way selfmettle tires him not a man in england can advise me like you be to yourself as you would to your friend be advised heat not a furnace for your foe so hot that it do singe yourself we may outrun by violent swiftness that which we run at and lose by overrunning know

what sudden angers this how have i reapd it he parted frowning from me as if ruin leapd from his eyes so looks the chafed lion upon the daring huntsman that has galld him then makes him nothing i must read this paper i fear the story of his anger tis so this paper has undone me tis the account of all that world of wealth i have drawn together for mine own ends indeed to gain the popedom and fee my friends in rome o negligence fit for a fool to fall by what cross devil made me put this main secret in the packet i sent the king is there no way to cure this no new device to beat this from his brains i know twill stir him strongly yet i know a way if it take right in spite of fortune will bring me off again whats this to the pope the letter as i live with all the business i writ tos holiness nay then farewell i have touchd the highest point of all my greatness and from that full meridian of my glory i haste now to my setting i shall fall like a bright exhalation m the evening and no man see me more till i find more than will or words to do it i mean your malice know officious lords i dare and must deny it now i feel of what coarse metal ye are moulded envy how eagerly ye follow my disgraces as if it fed ye and how sleek and wanton ye appear in every thing may bring my ruin follow your envious courses men of malice you have christian warrant for em and no doubt in time will find their fit rewards that seal you ask with such a violence the king mine and your master with his own hand gave me bade me enjoy it with the place and honours during my life and to confirm his goodness tied it by letterspatents now wholl take it it must be himself then proud lord thou liest within these forty hours surrey durst better have burnt that tongue than said so this and all else this talking lord can lay upon my credit i answer is most false the duke by law found his deserts how innocent i was from any private malice in his end his noble jury and foul cause can witness if i loved many words lord i should tell you you have as little honesty as honour that in the way of loyalty and truth toward the king my ever royal master dare mate a sounder man than surrey can be and all that love his follies all goodness is poison to thy stomach so much fairer and spotless shall mine innocence arise when the king knows my truth speak on sir i dare your worst objections if i blush it is to see a nobleman want manners so farewell to the little good you bear me farewell a long farewell to all my greatness this is the state of man today he puts forth the tender leaves of hopes tomorrow blossoms and bears his blushing honours thick upon him the third day comes a frost a killing frost and when he thinks good easy man full surely his greatness is aripening nips his root and then he falls as i do i have ventured like little wanton boys that swim on bladders this many summers in a sea of glory but far beyond my depth my highblown pride at length broke under me and now has left me weary and old with service to the mercy of a rude stream that must for ever hide me vain pomp and glory of this world i hate ye i feel my heart new opend o how wretched is that poor man that hangs on princes favours there is betwixt that smile we would aspire to that sweet aspect of princes and their ruin more pangs and fears than wars or women have and when he falls he falls like lucifer never to hope again   why how now cromwell what amazed at my misfortunes can thy spirit wonder a great man should decline nay an you weep i am falln indeed i hope i have i am able now methinks out of a fortitude of soul i feel to endure more miseries and greater far than my weakhearted enemies dare offer what news abroad god bless him thats somewhat sudden but hes a learned man may he continue long in his highness favour and do justice for truths sake and his conscience that his bones when he has run his course and sleeps in blessings may have a tomb of orphans tears wept on em what more thats news indeed there was the weight that pulld me down o cromwell the king has gone beyond me all my glories in that one woman i have lost for ever no sun shall ever usher forth mine honours or gild again the noble troops that waited upon my smiles go get thee from me cromwell i am a poor falln man unworthy now to be thy lord and master seek the king that sun i pray may never set i have told him what and how true thou art he will advance thee some little memory of me will stir him i know his noble naturenot to let thy hopeful service perish too good cromwell neglect him not make use now and provide for thine own future safety cromwell i did not think to shed a tear in all my miseries but thou hast forced me out of thy honest truth to play the woman lets dry our eyes and thus far hear me cromwell and when i am forgotten as i shall be and sleep in dull cold marble where no mention of me more must be heard of say i taught thee say wolsey that once trod the ways of glory and sounded all the depths and shoals of honour found thee a way out of his wreck to rise in a sure and safe one though thy master missd it mark but my fall and that that ruind me cromwell i charge thee fling away ambition by that sin fell the angels how can man then the image of his maker hope to win by it love thyself last cherish those hearts that hate thee corruption wins not more than honesty still in thy right hand carry gentle peace to silence envious tongues be just and fear not let all the ends thou aimst at be thy countrys thy gods and truths then if thou fallst o cromwell thou fallst a blessed martyr serve the king andprithee lead me in there take an inventory of all i have to the last penny tis the kings my robe and my integrity to heaven is all i dare now call mine own o cromwell

so please you ay please your graceis he in person ready and for me i have no further gone in this than by a single voice and that not passd me but by learned approbation of the judges if i am traduced by ignorant tongues which neither know my faculties nor person yet will be the chronicles of my doing let me say tis but the fate of place and the rough brake that virtue must go through we must not stint our necessary actions in the fear to cope malicious censurers which ever as ravenous fishes do a vessel follow that is newtrimmd but benefit no further than vainly longing what we oft do best by sick interpreters once weak ones is not ours or not allowd what worst as oft hitting a grosser quality is cried up for our best act if we shall stand still in fear our motion will be mockd or carpd at we should take root here where we sit or sit statestatues only now madam may his highness live in freedom and this man out of prison whats that what warlike voice and to what end is this nay ladies

tithe or toll in our dominions but as we under heaven are supreme head so under him that great supremacy where we do reign we will alone uphold without the assistance of a mortal hand so tell the pope all reverence set apart to him and his usurpd authority though you and all the kings of christendom are led so grossly by this meddling priest dreading the curse that money may buy out and by the

hast no cause to say so yet but thou shalt have and creep time neer so slow yet it shall come from me to do thee good i had a thing to say but let it go the sun is in the heaven and the proud day attended with the pleasures of the world is all too wanton and too full of gawds to give me audience if the midnight bell did with his iron tongue and brazen mouth sound on into the drowsy race of night if this same were a churchyard where we stand and thou possessed with a thousand wrongs or if that surly spirit melancholy had baked thy blood and made it heavythick which else runs tickling up and down the veins making that idiot laughter keep mens eyes and strain their cheeks to idle merriment a passion hateful to my purposes or if that thou couldst see me without eyes hear me without thine ears and make reply without a tongue using conceit alone without eyes ears and harmful sound of words then in despite of brooded watchful day i would into thy bosom pour my thoughts but ah i will not yet i love thee well and by my troth i think thou lovest me well do not i know thou wouldst good hubert hubert hubert throw thine eye on yon young boy ill tell thee what my friend he is a

so i do commit his youth to your direction hubert what news with you we cannot hold mortalitys strong hand good lords although my will to give is living the suit which you demand is gone and dead he tells us arthur is deceased tonight why do you bend such solemn brows on me think you i bear the shears of destiny have i commandment on the pulse of life they burn in indignation i repent there is no sure foundation set on blood no certain life achieved by others death   a fearful eye thou hast where is that blood that i have seen inhabit in those cheeks so foul a sky clears not without a storm pour down thy weather how goes all in france o where hath our intelligence been drunk where hath it slept where is my mothers care that such an army could be drawn in france and she not hear of it withhold thy speed dreadful occasion o make a league with me till i have pleased my discontented peers what mother dead how wildly then walks my estate in france under whose conduct came those powers of france that thou for truth givest out are landed here bear with me cousin for i was amazed under the tide but now i breathe again aloft the flood and can give audience to any tongue speak it of what it will thou idle dreamer wherefore didst thou so hubert away with him imprison him and on that day at noon whereon he says i shall yield up my crown let him be hangd deliver him to safety and return for i must use thee   o my gentle cousin hearst thou the news abroad who are arrived gentle kinsman go and thrust thyself into their companies i have a way to win their loves again bring them before me spoke like a sprightful noble gentleman go after him for he perhaps shall need some messenger betwixt me and the peers and be thou he my mother dead five moons why seekst thou to possess me with these fears why urgest thou so oft young arthurs death thy hand hath murderd him i had a mighty cause to wish him dead but thou hadst none to kill him it is the curse of kings to be attended by slaves that take their humours for a warrant to break within the bloody house of life and on the winking of authority to understand a law to know the meaning of dangerous majesty when perchance it frowns more upon humour than advised respect o when the last account twixt heaven and earth is to be made then shall this hand and seal witness against us to damnation how oft the sight of means to do ill deeds make deeds ill done hadst not thou been by a fellow by the hand of nature markd quoted and signd to do a deed of shame this murder had not come into my mind but taking note of thy abhorrd aspect finding thee fit for bloody villany apt liable to be employd in danger i faintly broke with thee of arthurs death and thou to be endeared to a king made it no conscience to destroy a prince hadst thou but shook thy head or made a pause when i spake darkly what i purposed or turnd an eye of doubt upon my face as bid me tell my tale in express words deep shame had struck me dumb made me break off and those thy fears might have wrought fears in me but thou didst understand me by my signs and didst in signs again parley with sin yea without stop didst let thy heart consent and consequently thy rude hand to act the deed which both our tongues held vile to name out of my sight and never see me more my nobles leave me and my state is braved even at my gates with ranks of foreign powers nay in the body of this fleshly land this kingdom this confine of blood and breath hostility and civil tumult reigns between my conscience and my cousins death doth arthur live o haste thee to the peers throw this report on their incensed rage and make them tame to their obedience forgive the comment that my passion made upon thy feature for my rage was blind and foul imaginary eyes of blood presented thee more hideous than thou art o answer not but to my closet bring the angry lords with all expedient haste i conjure thee but slowly run more fast thus have i yielded up into your hand the circle of my glory now keep your holy word go meet the french and from his holiness use all your power to stop their marches fore we are inflamed our discontented counties do revolt our people quarrel with obedience swearing allegiance and the love of soul to stranger blood to foreign royalty this inundation of mistemperd humour rests by you only to be qualified then pause not for the present times so sick that present medicine must be ministerd or overthrow incurable ensues is this ascensionday did not the prophet say that before ascensionday at noon my crown i should give off even so i have i did suppose it should be on constraint but heaven be thankd it is but voluntary would not my lords return to me again after they heard young arthur was alive that villain hubert told me he did live the legate of the pope hath been with me and i have made a happy peace with him and he hath promised to dismiss the powers led by the dauphin this fever that hath troubled me so long lies heavy on me o my heart is sick tell him toward swinstead to the abbey there ay me this tyrant fever burns me up and will not let me welcome this good news set on toward swinstead to my litter straight weakness possesseth me and i am faint ay marry now my soul hath elbowroom it would not out at windows nor at doors there is so hot a summer in my bosom that all my bowels crumble up to dust i am a scribbled form drawn with a pen upon a parchment and against this fire do i shrink up poisondill faredead forsook cast off and none of you will bid the winter come to thrust his icy fingers in my maw nor let my kingdoms rivers take their course through my burnd bosom nor entreat the north to make his bleak winds kiss my parched lips and comfort me with cold i do not ask you much i beg cold comfort and you are so strait and so ingrateful you deny me that the salt in them is hot within me is a hell and there the poison is as a fiend confined to tyrannize on unreprievable condemned blood o cousin thou art come to set mine eye the tackle of my heart is crackd and burnd and all the shrouds wherewith my life should sail are turned to one thread one little hair my heart hath one poor string to stay it by which holds but till thy news be uttered and then all this thou seest is but a clod and module of confounded royaltythus after greeting speaks the king of france in my behavior to the

these dukes what we decree   draw near and list what with our council we have done for that our kingdoms earth should not be soild with that dear blood which it hath fostered and for our eyes do hate

in our countrys cradle draws the sweet infant breath of gentle sleep which so roused up with boisterous untuned drums with harsh resounding trumpets dreadful bray and grating shock of wrathful iron arms might from our quiet confines fright fair peace and make us wade even in our kindreds blood therefore we banish you our territories you cousin hereford upon pain of life till twice five summers

our cousin cousin but tis doubt when time shall call him home from banishment whether our kinsman come to see his friends ourself and bushy bagot here and green observed his courtship to the common people how he did seem to dive into their hearts with humble and familiar courtesy what reverence he did throw away on slaves wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles and patient underbearing of his fortune as twere to banish their affects with him off goes his bonnet to an oysterwench a brace of draymen bid god speed him well and had the tribute of his supple knee with thanks my countrymen my loving friends as were our england in reversion his and he our subjects next degree in hope we will ourself in person to this war and for our coffers with too great a court and liberal largess are

much for that now for our irish wars we must supplant those rough rugheaded kerns which live like venom where no venom else but only they have privilege to live and for these great affairs do ask some charge towards our assistance we do seize to us the plate corn revenues and moveables whereof our uncle gaunt did stand possessd why uncle whats the matter think what you will we seize into our hands

barkloughly castle call they this at hand needs must i like it well i weep for joy to stand upon my kingdom once again dear earth i do salute thee with my hand though rebels wound thee with their horses hoofs as a longparted mother with her child plays fondly with her tears and smiles in meeting so weeping smiling greet i thee my earth and do thee favours with my royal hands feed not thy sovereigns foe my gentle earth nor with thy sweets comfort his ravenous sense but let thy spiders that suck up thy venom and heavygaited toads lie in their way doing annoyance to the treacherous feet which with usurping steps do trample thee yield stinging nettles to mine enemies and when they from thy bosom pluck a flower guard it i pray thee with a lurking adder whose double tongue may with a mortal touch throw death upon thy sovereigns enemies mock not my senseless conjuration lords this earth shall have a feeling and these stones prove armed soldiers ere her native king shall falter under foul rebellions arms discomfortable cousin knowst thou not that when the searching eye of heaven is hid behind the globe that lights the lower world then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen in murders and in outrage boldly here but when from under this terrestrial ball he fires the proud tops of the eastern pines and darts his light through every guilty hole then murders treasons and detested sins the cloak of night being pluckd from off their backs stand bare and naked trembling at themselves so when this thief this traitor bolingbroke who all this while hath revelld in the night whilst we were wandering with the antipodes shall see us rising in our throne the east his treasons will sit blushing in his face not able to endure the sight of day but selfaffrighted tremble at his sin not all the water in the rough rude sea can wash the balm off from an anointed king the breath of worldly men cannot depose the deputy elected by the lord for every man that bolingbroke hath pressd to lift shrewd steel against our golden crown god for his richard hath in heavenly pay a glorious angel then if angels fight weak men must fall for heaven still guards the right   welcome my lordhow far off lies your power but now the blood of twenty thousand men did triumph in my face and they are fled and till so much blood thither come again have i not reason to look pale and dead all souls that will be safe fly from my side for time hath set a blot upon my pride i had forgot myself am i not king awake thou coward majesty thou sleepest is not the kings name twenty thousand names arm arm my name a puny subject strikes at thy great glory look not to the ground ye favourites of a king are we not high high be our thoughts i know my uncle york hath power enough to serve our turn but who comes here mine ear is open and my heart prepared the worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold say is my kingdom lost why twas my care and what loss is it to be rid of care strives bolingbroke to be as great as we greater he shall not be if he serve god well serve him too and be his fellow so revolt our subjects that we cannot mend they break their faith to god as well as us cry woe destruction ruin and decay the worst is death and death will have his day too well too well thou tellst a tale so ill where is the earl of wiltshire where is bagot what is become of bushy where is green that they have let the dangerous enemy measure our confines with such peaceful steps if we prevail their heads shall pay for it i warrant they have made peace with bolingbroke o villains vipers damnd without redemption dogs easily won to fawn on any man snakes in my heartblood warmd that sting my heart three judases each one thrice worse than judas would they make peace terrible hell make war upon their spotted souls for this offence no matter where of comfort no man speak lets talk of graves of worms and epitaphs make dust our paper and with rainy eyes write sorrow on the bosom of the earth lets choose executors and talk of wills and yet not so for what can we bequeath save our deposed bodies to the ground our lands our lives and all are bolingbrokes and nothing can we call our own but death and that small model of the barren earth which serves as paste and cover to our bones for gods sake let us sit upon the ground and tell sad stories of the death of kings how some have been deposed some slain in war some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed some poisond by their wives some sleeping killd all murderd for within the hollow crown that rounds the mortal temples of a king keeps death his court and there the antic sits scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp allowing him a breath a little scene to monarchize be feard and kill with looks infusing him with self and vain conceit as if this flesh which walls about our life were brass impregnable and humourd thus comes at the last and with a little pin bores through his castle wall and farewell king cover your heads and mock not flesh and blood with solemn reverence throw away respect tradition form and ceremonious duty for you have but mistook me all this while i live with bread like you feel want taste grief need friends subjected thus how can you say to me i am a king we are amazed and thus long have we stood to watch the fearful bending of thy knee   because we thought ourself thy lawful king and if we be how dare thy joints forget to pay their awful duty to our presence if we be not show us the hand of god that hath dismissed us from our stewardship for well we know no hand of blood and bone can gripe the sacred handle of our sceptre unless he do profane steal or usurp and though you think that all as you have done have torn their souls by turning them from us and we are barren and bereft of friends yet know my master god omnipotent is mustering in his clouds on our behalf armies of pestilence and they shall strike your children yet unborn and unbegot that lift your vassal hands against my head and threat the glory of my precious crown tell bolingbrokefor yond methinks he stands that every stride he makes upon my land is dangerous treason he is come to open the purple testament of bleeding war but ere the crown he looks for live in peace ten thousand bloody crowns of mothers sons shall ill become the flower of englands face change the complexion of her maidpale peace to scarlet indignation and bedew her pastures grass with faithful english blood northumberland say thus the king returns his noble cousin is right welcome hither and all the number of his fair demands shall be accomplishd without contradiction with all the gracious utterance thou hast speak to his gentle hearing kind commends we do debase ourselves cousin do we not   to look so poorly and to speak so fair shall we call back northumberland and send defiance to the traitor and so die what must the king do now must he submit the king shall do it must he be deposed the king shall be contented must he lose the name of king o gods name let it go ill give my jewels for a set of beads my gorgeous palace for a hermitage my gay apparel for an almsmans gown my figured goblets for a dish of wood my sceptre for a palmers walking staff my subjects for a pair of carved saints and my large kingdom for a little grave a little little grave an obscure grave or ill be buried in the kings highway some way of common trade where subjects feet may hourly trample on their sovereigns head for on my heart they tread now whilst i live and buried once why not upon my head aumerle thou weepst my tenderhearted cousin well make foul weather with despised tears our sighs and they shall lodge the summer corn and make a dearth in this revolting land or shall we play the wantons with our woes and make some pretty match with shedding tears as thus to drop them still upon one place till they have fretted us a pair of graves within the earth and therein laidthere lies two kinsmen diggd their graves with weeping eyes would not this ill do well well well i see i talk but idly and you laugh at me most mighty prince my lord northumberland what says king bolingbroke will his majesty give richard leave to live till richard die you make a leg and bolingbroke says ay down down i come like glistering phaethon wanting the manage of unruly jades in the base court base court where kings grow base to come at traitors calls and do them grace in the base court come down down court down king for nightowls shriek where mounting larks should sing fair cousin you debase your princely knee to make the base earth proud with kissing it me rather had my heart might feel your love than my unpleased eye see your courtesy up cousin up your heart is up i know thus high at least although your knee

should say i was too strict to make mine own away but you gave leave to my unwilling tongue against my will to do myself this wrong o to what purpose dost thou hoard thy words that thou returnst no greeting to thy friends thy grief is but thy absence for a time what is six winters they are quickly gone call it a travel that thou takest for pleasure the sullen passage of thy weary steps esteem as foil wherein thou art to set the precious jewel of thy home return will the king come that i may breathe my last in wholesome counsel to his unstaid youth o but they say the tongues of dying men enforce attention like deep harmony where words are scarce they are seldom spent in vain for they breathe truth that breathe their words in pain he that no more must say is listend more than they whom youth and ease have taught to glose more are mens ends markd than their lives before the setting sun and music at the close as the last taste of sweets is sweetest last writ in remembrance more than

Richard III,now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer by this sun of york and all the clouds that lourd upon our house in the deep bosom of the ocean buried now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths our bruised arms hung up for monuments our stern alarums changed to merry meetings our dreadful marches to delightful measures grimvisaged war hath smoothd his wrinkled front and now instead of mounting barbed steeds to fright the souls of fearful adversaries he capers nimbly in a ladys chamber to the lascivious pleasing of a lute but i that am not shaped for sportive tricks nor made to court an amorous lookingglass i that am rudely stampd and want loves majesty to strut before a wanton ambling nymph i that am curtaild of this fair proportion cheated of feature by dissembling nature deformed unfinishd sent before my time into this breathing world scarce half made up and that so lamely and unfashionable that dogs bark at me as i halt by them why i in this weak piping time of peace have no delight to pass away the time unless to spy my shadow in the sun and descant on mine own deformity and therefore since i cannot prove a lover to entertain these fair wellspoken days i am determined to prove a villain and hate the idle pleasures of these days plots have i laid inductions dangerous by drunken prophecies libels and dreams to set my brother clarence and the king in deadly hate the one against the other and if king edward be as true and just as i am subtle false and treacherous this day should clarence closely be mewd up about a prophecy which says that g of edwards heirs the murderer shall be dive thoughts down to my soul here clarence comes   brother good day what means this armed guard that waits upon your grace upon what cause alack my lord that fault is none of yours he should for that commit your godfathers o belike his majesty hath some intent that you shall be newchristend in the tower but whats the matter clarence  may i know why this it is when men are ruled by women tis not the king that sends you to the tower my lady grey his wife clarence tis she that tempers him to this extremity was it not she and that good man of worship anthony woodville her brother there that made him send lord hastings to the tower from whence this present day he is deliverd we are not safe clarence we are not safe humbly complaining to her deity got my lord chamberlain his liberty ill tell you what i think it is our way if we will keep in favour with the king to be her men and wear her livery the jealous oerworn widow and herself since that our brother dubbd them gentlewomen are mighty gossips in this monarchy even so ant please your worship brakenbury you may partake of any thing we say we speak no treason man we say the king is wise and virtuous and his noble queen well struck in years fair and not jealous we say that shores wife hath a pretty foot a cherry lip a bonny eye a passing pleasing tongue and that the queens kindred are made gentlefolks how say you sir can you deny all this naught to do with mistress shore i tell thee fellow he that doth naught with her excepting one were best he do it secretly alone her husband knave wouldst thou betray me we are the queens abjects and must obey brother farewell i will unto the king and whatsoever you will employ me in were it to call king edwards widow sister i will perform it to enfranchise you meantime this deep disgrace in brotherhood touches me deeper than you can imagine well your imprisonment shall not be long meantime have patience go tread the path that thou shalt neer return simple plain clarence i do love thee so that i will shortly send thy soul to heaven if heaven will take the present at our hands but who comes here the newdeliverd hastings as much unto my good lord chamberlain well are you welcome to the open air how hath your lordship brookd imprisonment no doubt no doubt and so shall clarence too for they that were your enemies are his and have prevaild as much on him as you what news abroad now by saint paul this news is bad indeed o he hath kept an evil diet long and overmuch consumed his royal person tis very grievous to be thought upon what is he in his bed go you before and i will follow you   he cannot live i hope and must not die till george be packd with posthorse up to heaven ill in to urge his hatred more to clarence with lies well steeld with weighty arguments and if i fall not in my deep intent clarence hath not another day to live which done god take king edward to his mercy and leave the world for me to bustle in for then ill marry warwicks youngest daughter what though i killd her husband and her father the readiest way to make the wench amends is to become her husband and her father the which will i not all so much for love as for another secret close intent by marrying her which i must reach unto but yet i run before my horse to market clarence still breathes edward still lives and reigns when they are gone then must i count my gains stay you that bear the corse and set it down villains set down the corse or by saint paul ill make a corse of him that disobeys unmannerd dog stand thou when i command advance thy halbert higher than my breast or by saint paul ill strike thee to my foot and spurn upon thee beggar for thy boldness sweet saint for charity be not so curst lady you know no rules of charity which renders good for bad blessings for curses but i know none and therefore am no beast more wonderful when angels are so angry vouchsafe divine perfection of a woman of these supposedevils to give me leave by circumstance but to acquit myself fairer than tongue can name thee let me have some patient leisure to excuse myself by such despair i should accuse myself say that i slew them not i did not kill your husband nay he is dead and slain by edwards hand i was provoked by her slanderous tongue which laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders i grant ye the fitter for the king of heaven that hath him let him thank me that holp to send him thither for he was fitter for that place than earth yes one place else if you will hear me name it your bedchamber so will it madam till i lie with you i know so but gentle lady anne to leave this keen encounter of our wits and fall somewhat into a slower method is not the causer of the timeless deaths of these plantagenets henry and edward as blameful as the executioner your beauty was the cause of that effect your beauty which did haunt me in my sleep to undertake the death of all the world so i might live one hour in your sweet bosom these eyes could never endure sweet beautys wreck you should not blemish it if i stood by as all the world is cheered by the sun so i by that it is my day my life curse not thyself fair creature thou art both it is a quarrel most unnatural to be revenged on him that loveth you he that bereft thee lady of thy husband did it to help thee to a better husband he lives that loves thee better than he could plantagenet the selfsame name but one of better nature here   why dost thou spit at me never came poison from so sweet a place thine eyes sweet lady have infected mine i would they were that i might die at once for now they kill me with a living death those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears shamed their aspect with store of childish drops these eyes that never shed remorseful tear no when my father york and edward wept to hear the piteous moan that rutland made when blackfaced clifford shook his sword at him nor when thy warlike father like a child told the sad story of my fathers death and twenty times made pause to sob and weep that all the standersby had wet their cheeks like trees bedashd with rain in that sad time my manly eyes did scorn an humble tear and what these sorrows could not thence exhale thy beauty hath and made them blind with weeping i never sued to friend nor enemy my tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word but now thy beauty is proposed my fee my proud heart sues and prompts my tongue to speak   teach not thy lips such scorn for they were made for kissing lady not for such contempt if thy revengeful heart cannot forgive lo here i lend thee this sharppointed sword which if thou please to hide in this true bosom and let the soul forth that adoreth thee i lay it naked to the deadly stroke and humbly beg the death upon my knee   nay do not pause for i did kill king henry but twas thy beauty that provoked me nay now dispatch twas i that stabbd young edward but twas thy heavenly face that set me on   take up the sword again or take up me then bid me kill myself and i will do it tush that was in thy rage speak it again and even with the word that hand which for thy love did kill thy love shall for thy love kill a far truer love to both their deaths thou shalt be accessary tis figured in my tongue then never man was true say then my peace is made but shall i live in hope vouchsafe to wear this ring look how this ring encompasseth finger even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart wear both of them for both of them are thine and if thy poor devoted suppliant may but beg one favour at thy gracious hand thou dost confirm his happiness for ever that it would please thee leave these sad designs to him that hath more cause to be a mourner and presently repair to crosby place where after i have solemnly interrd at chertsey monastery this noble king and wet his grave with my repentant tears i will with all expedient duty see you for divers unknown reasons i beseech you grant me this boon bid me farewell sirs take up the corse no to whitefriars there attend my coining   was ever woman in this humour wood was ever woman in this humour won ill have her but i will not keep her long what i that killd her husband and his father to take her in her hearts extremest hate with curses in her mouth tears in her eyes the bleeding witness of her hatred by having god her conscience and these bars against me and i nothing to back my suit at all but the plain devil and dissembling looks and yet to win her all the world to nothing ha hath she forgot already that brave prince edward her lord whom i some three months since stabbd in my angry mood at tewksbury a sweeter and a lovelier gentleman framed in the prodigality of nature young valiant wise and no doubt right royal the spacious world cannot again afford and will she yet debase her eyes on me that croppd the golden prime of this sweet prince and made her widow to a woful bed on me whose all not equals edwards moiety on me that halt and am unshapen thus my dukedom to a beggarly denier i do mistake my person all this while upon my life she finds although i cannot myself to be a marvellous proper man ill be at charges for a lookingglass and entertain some score or two of tailors to study fashions to adorn my body since i am crept in favour with myself will maintain it with some little cost but first ill turn yon fellow in his grave and then return lamenting to my love shine out fair sun till i have bought a glass that i may see my shadow as i pass they do me wrong and i will not endure it who are they that complain unto the king that i forsooth am stern and love them not by holy paul they love his grace but lightly that fill his ears with such dissentious rumours because i cannot flatter and speak fair smile in mens faces smooth deceive and cog duck with french nods and apish courtesy i must be held a rancorous enemy cannot a plain man live and think no harm but thus his simple truth must be abused by silken sly insinuating jacks to thee that hast nor honesty nor grace when have i injured thee when done thee wrong or thee or thee or any of your faction a plague upon you all his royal person whom god preserve better than you would wish cannot be quiet scarce a breathingwhile but you must trouble him with lewd complaints i cannot tell the world is grown so bad that wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch since every jack became a gentleman theres many a gentle person made a jack meantime god grants that we have need of you your brother is imprisond by your means myself disgraced and the nobility held in contempt whilst many fair promotions are daily given to ennoble those that scarce some two days since were worth a noble you may deny that you were not the cause of my lord hastings late imprisonment she may lord rivers why who knows not so she may do more sir than denying that she may help you to many fair preferments and then deny her aiding hand therein and lay those honours on your high deserts what may she not she may yea marry may she what marry may she marry with a king a bachelor a handsome stripling too i wis your grandam had a worser match what threat you me with telling of the king tell him and spare not look what i have said i will avouch in presence of the king i dare adventure to be sent to the tower tis time to speak my pains are quite forgot ere you were queen yea or your husband king i was a packhorse in his great affairs a weederout of his proud adversaries a liberal rewarder of his friends to royalize his blood i spilt mine own in all which time you and your husband grey were factious for the house of lancaster and rivers so were you was not your husband in margarets battle at saint albans slain let me put in your minds if you forget what you have been ere now and what you are withal what i have been and what i am poor clarence did forsake his father warwick yea and forswore himselfwhich jesu pardon to fight on edwards party for the crown and for his meed poor lord he is mewd up i would to god my heart were flint like edwards or edwards soft and pitiful like mine i am too childishfoolish for this world if i should be i had rather be a pedlar far be it from my heart the thought of it foul wrinkled witch what makest thou in my sight wert thou not banished on pain of death the curse my noble father laid on thee when thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper and with thy scorns drewst rivers from his eyes and then to dry them gavest the duke a clout steepd in the faultless blood of pretty rutland his curses then from bitterness of soul denounced against thee are all falln upon thee and god not we hath plagued thy bloody deed have done thy charm thou hateful witherd hag margaret ha i cry thee mercy then for i had thought that thou hadst calld me all these bitter names tis done by me and ends in margaret good counsel marry learn it learn it marquess yea and much more but i was born so high our aery buildeth in the cedars top and dallies with the wind and scorns the sun what doth she say my lord of buckingham i cannot blame her by gods holy mother she hath had too much wrong and i repent my part thereof that i have done to her but you have all the vantage of her wrong i was too hot to do somebody good that is too cold in thinking of it now marry as for clarence he is well repaid he is frankd up to fatting for his pains god pardon them that are the cause of it so do i ever   being welladvised for had i cursed now i had cursed myself i do the wrong and first begin to brawl the secret mischiefs that i set abroach i lay unto the grievous charge of others clarence whom i indeed have laid in darkness i do beweep to many simple gulls namely to hastings derby buckingham and say it is the queen and her allies that stir the king against the duke my brother now they believe it and withal whet me to be revenged on rivers vaughan grey but then i sigh and with a piece of scripture tell them that god bids us do good for evil and thus i clothe my naked villany with old odd ends stolen out of holy writ and seem a saint when most i play the devil   but soft here come my executioners how now my hardy stout resolved mates are you now going to dispatch this deed well thought upon i have it here about me   when you have done repair to crosby place but sirs be sudden in the execution withal obdurate do not hear him plead for clarence is wellspoken and perhaps may move your hearts to pity if you mark him your eyes drop millstones when fools eyes drop tears i like you lads about your business straight go go dispatch good morrow to my sovereign king and queen and princely peers a happy time of day a blessed labour my most sovereign liege amongst this princely heap if any here by false intelligence or wrong surmise hold me a foe if i unwittingly or in my rage have aught committed that is hardly borne by any in this presence i desire to reconcile me to his friendly peace tis death to me to be at enmity i hate it and desire all good mens love first madam i entreat true peace of you which i will purchase with my duteous service of you my noble cousin buckingham if ever any grudge were lodged between us of you lord rivers and lord grey of you that without desert have frownd on me dukes earls lords gentlemen indeed of all i do not know that englishman alive with whom my soul is any jot at odds more than the infant that is born tonight i thank my god for my humility why madam have i offerd love for this to be so bouted in this royal presence who knows not that the noble duke is dead   you do him injury to scorn his corse but he poor soul by your first order died and that a winged mercury did bear some tardy cripple bore the countermand that came too lag to see him buried god grant that some less noble and less loyal nearer in bloody thoughts but not in blood deserve not worse than wretched clarence did and yet go current from suspicion this is the fruit of rashness markd you not how that the guilty kindred of the queen lookd pale when they did hear of clarence death o they did urge it still unto the king god will revenge it but come let us in to comfort edward with our company madam have comfort all of us have cause to wail the dimming of our shining star but none can cure their harms by wailing them madam my mother i do cry you mercy i did not see your grace humbly on my knee i crave your blessing aside  amen and make me die a good old man that is the buttend of a mothers blessing i marvel why her grace did leave it out i hope the king made peace with all of us and the compact is firm and true in me then be it so and go we to determine who they shall be that straight shall post to ludlow madam and you my mother will you go to give your censures in this weighty business my other self my counsels consistory my oracle my prophet my dear cousin i like a child will go by thy direction towards ludlow then for well not stay behind welcome dear cousin my thoughts sovereign the weary way hath made you melancholy sweet prince the untainted virtue of your years hath not yet dived into the worlds deceit nor more can you distinguish of a man than of his outward show which god he knows seldom or never jumpeth with the heart those uncles which you want were dangerous your grace attended to their sugard words but lookd not on the poison of their hearts  god keep you from them and from such false friends my lord the mayor of london comes to greet you where it seems best unto your royal self if i may counsel you some day or two your highness shall repose you at the tower then where you please and shall be thought most fit for your best health and recreation aside  so wise so young they say do never live long i say without characters fame lives

cousin i must not say so he may command me as my sovereign but you have power in me as in a kinsman my dagger little cousin with all my heart a greater gift than that ill give my cousin a gentle cousin were it light enough it is too heavy for your grace to wear what would you have my weapon little lord how my lord willt please you pass along myself and my good cousin buckingham will to your mother to entreat of her to meet you at the tower and welcome you why what should you fear nor none that live i hope no doubt no doubt o tis a parlous boy bold quick ingenious forward capable he is all the mothers from the top to toe commend me to lord william tell him catesby his ancient knot of dangerous adversaries tomorrow are let blood at pomfretcastle and bid my friend for joy of this good news give mistress shore one gentle kiss the more shall we hear from you catesby ere we sleep at crosby place there shall you find us both chop off his head man somewhat we will do and look when i am king claim thou of me the earldom of hereford and the moveables whereof the king my brother stood possessd and look to have it yielded with all willingness come let us sup betimes that afterwards we may digest our complots in some form my noble lords and cousins all good morrow i have been long a sleeper but i hope my absence doth neglect no great designs which by my presence might have been concluded than my lord hastings no man might be bolder his lordship knows me well and loves me well my lord of ely when i was last in holborn i saw good strawberries in your garden there i do beseech you send for some of them cousin of buckingham a word with you   catesby hath sounded hastings in our business and finds the testy gentleman so hot as he will lose his head ere give consent his masters son as worshipful as he terms it shall lose the royalty of englands throne i pray you all tell me what they deserve that do conspire my death with devilish plots of damned witchcraft and that have prevaild upon my body with their hellish charms then be your eyes the witness of this ill see how i am bewitchd behold mine arm is like a blasted sapling witherd up and this is edwards wife that monstrous witch consorted with that harlot strumpet shore that by their witchcraft thus have marked me if i thou protector of this damned strumpet tellest thou me of ifs  thou art a traitor off with his head now by saint paul i swear i will not dine until i see the same lovel and ratcliff look that it be done the rest that love me rise and follow me come cousin canst thou quake and change thy colour murder thy breath in the middle of a word and then begin again and stop again as if thou wert distraught and mad with terror he is and see he brings the mayor along look to the drawbridge there catesby oerlook the walls look back defend thee here are enemies be patient they are friends ratcliff and lovel so dear i loved the man that i must weep i took him for the plainest harmless creature that breathed upon this earth a christian made him my book wherein my soul recorded the history of all her secret thoughts so smooth he daubd his vice with show of virtue that his apparent open guilt omitted i mean his conversation with shores wife he lived from all attainder of suspect what think you we are turks or infidels or that we would against the form of law proceed thus rashly to the villains death but that the extreme peril of the case the peace of england and our persons safety enforced us to this execution yet had not we determined he should die until your lordship came to see his death which now the loving haste of these our friends somewhat against our meaning have prevented because my lord we would have had you heard the traitor speak and timorously confess the manner and the purpose of his treason that you might well have signified the same unto the citizens who haply may misconstrue us in him and wail his death and to that end we wishd your lordship here to avoid the carping censures of the world go after after cousin buckingham the mayor towards guildhall hies him in all post there at your meetst advantage of the time infer the bastardy of edwards children tell them how edward put to death a citizen only for saying he would make his son heir to the crown meaning indeed his house which by the sign thereof was termed so moreover urge his hateful luxury and bestial appetite in change of lust which stretched to their servants daughters wives even where his lustful eye or savage heart without control listed to make his prey nay for a need thus far come near my person tell them when that my mother went with child of that unsatiate edward noble york my princely father then had wars in france and by just computation of the time found that the issue was not his begot which well appeared in his lineaments being nothing like the noble duke my father but touch this sparingly as twere far off because you know my lord my mother lives if you thrive well bring them to baynards castle where you shall find me well accompanied with reverend fathers and welllearned bishops go lovel with all speed to doctor shaw   go thou to friar penker bid them both meet me within this hour at baynards castle   now will i in to take some privy order to draw the brats of clarence out of sight and to give notice that no manner of person at any time have recourse unto the princes how now my lord what say the citizens touchd you the bastardy of edwards children ah and did they so what tongueless blocks were they would not they speak will not the mayor then and his brethren come i go and if you plead as well for them as i can say nay to thee for myself no doubt well bring it to a happy issue my lord there needs no such apology i rather do beseech you pardon me who earnest in the service of my god neglect the visitation of my friends but leaving this what is your graces pleasure i do suspect i have done some offence that seems disgracious in the citys eyes and that you come to reprehend my ignorance else wherefore breathe i in a christian land i know not whether to depart in silence or bitterly to speak in your reproof best fitteth my degree or your condition if not to answer you might haply think tonguetied ambition not replying yielded to bear the golden yoke of sovereignty which fondly you would here impose on me if to reprove you for this suit of yours so seasond with your faithful love to me then on the other side i chequed my friends therefore to speak and to avoid the first and then in speaking not to incur the last definitively thus i answer you your love deserves my thanks but my desert unmeritable shuns your high request first if all obstacles were cut away and that my path were even to the crown as my ripe revenue and due by birth yet so much is my poverty of spirit so mighty and so many my defects as i had rather hide me from my greatness being a bark to brook no mighty sea than in my greatness covet to be hid and in the vapour of my glory smotherd but god be thankd theres no need of me and much i need to help you if need were the royal tree hath left us royal fruit which mellowd by the stealing hours of time will well become the seat of majesty and make no doubt us happy by his reign on him i lay what you would lay on me the right and fortune of his happy stars which god defend that i should wring from him alas why would you heap these cares on me i am unfit for state and majesty i do beseech you take it not amiss i cannot nor i will not yield to you o do not swear my lord of buckingham would you enforce me to a world of care well call them again i am not made of stone but penetrable to your kind entreats albeit against my conscience and my soul   cousin of buckingham and you sage grave men since you will buckle fortune on my back to bear her burthen whether i will or no i must have patience to endure the load but if black scandal or foulfaced reproach attend the sequel of your imposition your mere enforcement shall acquittance me from all the impure blots and stains thereof for god he knows and you may partly see how far i am from the desire thereof in saying so you shall but say the truth even when you please since you will have it so come let us to our holy task again farewell good cousin farewell gentle friendshis majesty tendering my persons safety hath appointed this conduct to convey me to the tower because my name is george yea richard when i know for i protest as yet i do not but as i can learn he hearkens after prophecies and dreams and from the crossrow plucks the letter g and says a wizard told him that by g his issue disinherited should be and for my name of george begins with g it follows in his thought that i am he these as i learn and such like toys as these have moved his highness to commit me now by heaven i think theres no man is secure but the queens kindred and nightwalking heralds that trudge betwixt the king and mistress shore heard ye not what an humble suppliant lord hastings was to her for his delivery we know thy charge brakenbury and will obey i know it pleaseth neither of us well i must perforce farewell o i have passd a miserable night so full of ugly sights of ghastly dreams that as i am a christian faithful man i would not spend another such a night though twere to buy a world of happy days so full of dismal terror was the time methoughts that i had broken from the tower and was embarkd to cross to burgundy and in my company my brother gloucester who from my cabin tempted me to walk upon the hatches thence we looked toward england and cited up a thousand fearful times during the wars of york and lancaster that had befalln us as we paced along upon the giddy footing of the hatches methought that gloucester stumbled and in falling struck me that thought to stay him overboard into the tumbling billows of the main lord lord methought what pain it was to drown what dreadful noise of waters in mine ears what ugly sights of death within mine eyes methought i saw a thousand fearful wrecks ten thousand men that fishes gnawd upon wedges of gold great anchors heaps of pearl inestimable stones unvalued jewels all scatterd in the bottom of the sea some lay in dead mens skulls and in those holes where eyes did once inhabit there were crept as twere in scorn of eyes reflecting gems which wood the slimy bottom of the deep and mockd the dead bones that lay scatterd by methought i had and often did i strive to yield the ghost but still the envious flood kept in my soul and would not let it forth to seek the empty vast and wandering air but smotherd it within my panting bulk which almost burst to belch it in the sea o no my dream was lengthend after life o then began the tempest to my soul who passd methought the melancholy flood with that grim ferryman which poets write of unto the kingdom of perpetual night the first that there did greet my stranger soul was my great fatherinlaw renowned warwick who cried aloud what scourge for perjury can this dark monarchy afford false clarence and so he vanishd then came wandering by a shadow like an angel with bright hair dabbled in blood and he squeakd out aloud clarence is come false fleeting perjured clarence that stabbd me in the field by tewksbury seize on him furies take him to your torments with that methoughts a legion of foul fiends environd me about and howled in mine ears such hideous cries that with the very noise i trembling waked and for a season after could not believe but that i was in hell such terrible impression made the dream o brakenbury i have done those things which now bear evidence against my soul for edwards sake and see how he requites me o god if my deep prayers cannot appease thee but thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds yet execute thy wrath in me alone o spare my guiltless wife and my poor children i pray thee gentle keeper stay by me my soul is heavy and i fain would sleep where art thou keeper give me a cup of wine in gods name what art thou but not as i am royal thy voice is thunder but thy looks are humble how darkly and how deadly dost thou speak your eyes do menace me why look you pale who sent you hither wherefore do you come to murder me you scarcely have the hearts to tell me so and therefore cannot have the hearts to do it wherein my friends have i offended you i shall be reconciled to him again are you calld forth from out a world of men to slay the innocent what is my offence where are the evidence that do accuse me what lawful quest have given their verdict up unto the frowning judge or who pronounced the bitter sentence of poor clarence death before i be convict by course of law to threaten me with death is most unlawful i charge you as you hope to have redemption by christs dear blood shed for our grievous sins that you depart and lay no hands on me the deed you undertake is damnable erroneous vassal the great king of kings hath in the tables of his law commanded that thou shalt do no murder and wilt thou then spurn at his edict and fulfil a mans take heed for he holds vengeance in his hands to hurl upon their heads that break his law alas for whose sake did i that ill deed for edward for my brother for his sake why sirs he sends ye not to murder me for this for in this sin he is as deep as i if god will be revenged for this deed o know you yet he,History,26

known you laugh when boys or women tell their dreams ist not your trick i dreamd there was an emperor antony o such another sleep that i might see but such another man his face was as the heavens and therein stuck a sun and moon which kept their course and lighted the little o the earth his legs bestrid the ocean his reard arm crested the world his voice was propertied as all the tuned spheres and that to friends but when he meant to quail and shake the orb he was as rattling thunder for his bounty there was no winter int an autumn twas that grew the more by reaping his delights were dolphinlike they showd his back above the element they lived in in his livery walkd crowns and crownets realms and islands were as plates droppd from his pocket think you there was or might be such a man as this i dreamd of you lie up to the hearing of the gods but if there be or ever were one such its past the size of dreaming nature wants stuff to vie strange forms with fancy yet to imagine and antony were natures piece gainst fancy condemning shadows quite i thank you sir know you what caesar means to do with me nay pray you sir hell lead me then in triumph sir the gods will have it thus my

shame is this that thou vouchsafing here to visit me doing the honour of thy lordliness to one so meek that mine own servant should parcel the sum of my disgraces by addition of his envy say good caesar that i some lady trifles have reserved immoment toys things of such dignity as we greet modern friends withal and say some nobler token i have kept apart for livia and octavia to induce their mediation must i be unfolded with one that i have bred the gods it smites me beneath the fall i have   prithee go hence or i shall show the cinders of my spirits through the ashes of my chance wert thou a man thou wouldst have mercy on me be it known that we the greatest are misthought for things that others do and when we fall we answer others merits in our name are therefore to be pitied my

Coriolanus,before we proceed any further hear me speak you are all resolved rather to die than to famish we are accounted poor citizens the patricians good what authority surfeits on would relieve us if they would yield us but the superfluity while it were wholesome we might guess they relieved us humanely but they think we are too dear the leanness that afflicts us the object of our misery is as an inventory to particularise their abundance our sufferance is a gain to them let us revenge this with our pikes ere we become rakes for the gods know i speak this in hunger for bread not in thirst for revenge very well and could be content to give him good report fort but that he pays himself with being proud i say unto you what he hath done famously he did it to that end though softconscienced men can be content to say it was for his country he did it to please his mother and to be partly proud which he is even till the altitude of his virtue if i must not i need not be barren of accusations he hath faults with surplus to tire in repetition   what shouts are these the other side o the city is risen why stay we prating here to the capitol soft who comes here hes one honest enough would all the rest were so our business is not unknown to the senate they have had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do which now well show em in deeds they say poor suitors have strong breaths they shall know we have strong arms too we cannot sir we are undone already well ill hear it sir yet you must not think to fob off our disgrace with a tale but an t please you deliver well sir

petty helps in this our fabric if that they should by the cormorant belly be restraind who is the sink o the body yere long about it ay sir well well it was an answer how apply you this we have ever your good word once if he do require our voices we ought not to deny him the price is to ask it kindly he has our voices sir notis his kind of speech he did not mock us i twice five hundred and their friends to piece em ourselves our wives and children on our knees are bound to pray for you both for mine own part when i said banish him i said twas pity the gods be good to us come masters lets home

come the gods assist you farewell to the pot i warrant him slain sir doubtless caius marcius coriolanus welcome to rome renowned coriolanus content content we will so almost all repent in their election in in in in welcome ladies welcomefirst you know caius marcius is chief enemy to the people let us kill him and well have corn at our own price ist a verdict worthy menenius agrippa one that hath always loved the people care for us true indeed they neer cared for us yet suffer us to famish and their storehouses crammed with grain make edicts for usury to support usurers repeal daily any wholesome act established against the rich and provide more piercing statutes daily to chain up and restrain the poor if the wars eat us not up they will and theres all the love they bear us the former agents if they did complain what could the belly answer i the great toe why the great toe and to make us no better thought of a little help will serve for once we stood up about the corn he himself stuck not to call us the manyheaded multitude we do sir tell us what hath brought you tot your own desert you must think if we give you any thing we hope to gain by you you have deserved nobly of your country and you have not deserved nobly we hope to find you our friend and therefore give you our voices heartily therefore let him be consul the gods give him joy and make him good friend to the people he shall well know the noble tribunes are the peoples mouths and we their hands and you he is and feasts the nobles of the state at his house this night this here before you and so did i and to say the truth so did very many of us that we did we did for the best and though we willingly consented to his banishment yet it was against our willone word good citizens would you proceed especially against caius marcius consider you what services he has done for his country nay but speak not maliciously what he cannot help in his nature you account a vice in him you must in no way say he is covetous we may sir if we will think you so which way do you judge my wit would fly why that way you are never without your tricks you may you may you shall ha it worthy sir an twere to give againbut tis no matter amen sir to my poor unworthy notice he mockd us when he beggd our voices not one amongst us save yourself but says he used us scornfully he should have showd us his marks of merit wounds received fors country and will deny him ill have five hundred voices of that sound and so did i so did we all but come lets homewhat works my countrymen in hand where go you with bats and clubs the matter speak i pray you why masters my good friends mine honest neighbours will you undo yourselves i tell you friends most charitable care have the patricians of you for your wants your suffering in this dearth you may as well strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them against the roman state whose course will on the way it takes cracking ten thousand curbs of more strong link asunder than can ever appear in your impediment for the dearth the gods not the patricians make it and your knees to them not arms must help alack you are transported by calamity thither where more attends you and you slander the helms o the state who care for you like fathers when you curse them as enemies either you must confess yourselves wondrous malicious or be accused of folly i shall tell you a pretty tale it may be you have heard it but since it serves my purpose i will venture to stale t a little more there was a time when all the bodys members rebelld against the belly thus accused it that only like a gulf it did remain i the midst o the body idle and unactive still cupboarding the viand never bearing like labour with the rest where the other instruments did see and hear devise instruct walk feel and mutually participate did minister unto the appetite and affection common of the whole body the belly answerd sir i shall tell you with a kind of smile which neer came from the lungs but even thus for look you i may make the belly smile as well as speakit tauntingly replied to the discontented members the mutinous parts that envied his receipt even so most fitly as you malign our senators for that they are not such as you what then fore me this fellow speaks what then what then well what then i will tell you if youll bestow a smallof what you have little patience awhile youll hear the bellys answer note me this good friend your most grave belly was deliberate not rash like his accusers and thus answerd true is it my incorporate friends quoth he that i receive the general food at first which you do live upon and fit it is because i am the storehouse and the shop of the whole body but if you do remember i send it through the rivers of your blood even to the court the heart to the seat o the brain and through the cranks and offices of man the strongest nerves and small inferior veins from me receive that natural competency whereby they live and though that all at once you my good friendsthis says the belly mark me though all at once cannot see what i do deliver out to each yet i can make my audit up that all from me do back receive the flour of all and leave me but the bran what say you tot the senators of rome are this good belly and you the mutinous members for examine their counsels and their cares digest things rightly touching the weal o the common you shall find no public benefit which you receive but it proceeds or comes from them to you and no way from yourselves what do you think you the great toe of this assembly for that being one o the lowest basest poorest of this most wise rebellion thou gost foremost thou rascal that art worst in blood to run leadst first to win some vantage but make you ready your stiff bats and clubs rome and her rats are at the point of battle the one side must have bale   hail noble marcius for corn at their own rates whereof they say the city is well stored nay these are almost thoroughly persuaded for though abundantly they lack discretion yet are they passing cowardly but i beseech you what says the other troop what is granted them this is strange o truebred the augurer tells me we shall have news tonight not according to the prayer of the people for they love not marcius pray you who does the wolf love ay to devour him as the hungry plebeians would the noble marcius hes a bear indeed that lives like a lamb you two are old men tell me one thing that i shall ask you in what enormity is marcius poor in that you two have not in abundance this is strange now do you two know how you are censured here in the city i mean of us o the righthand file do you because you talk of pride nowwill you not be angry why tis no great matter for a very little thief of occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience give your dispositions the reins and be angry at your pleasures at the least if you take it as a pleasure to you in being so you blame marcius for being proud i know you can do very little alone for your helps are many or else your actions would grow wondrous single your abilities are too infantlike for doing much alone you talk of pride o that you could turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks and make but an interior survey of your good selves o that you could why then you should discover a brace of unmeriting proud violent testy magistrates alias fools as any in rome i am known to be a humorous patrician and one that loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying tiber int said to be something imperfect in favouring the first complaint hasty and tinderlike upon too trivial motion one that converses more with the buttock of the night than with the forehead of the morning what i think i utter and spend my malice in my breath meeting two such wealsmen as you arei cannot call you lycurgusesif the drink you give me touch my palate adversely i make a crooked face at it i cant say your worships have delivered the matter well when i find the ass in compound with the major part of your syllables and though i must be content to bear with those that say you are reverend grave men yet they lie deadly that tell you you have good faces if you see this in the map of my microcosm follows it that i am known well enough too what barm can your bisson conspectuities glean out of this character if i be known well enough too you know neither me yourselves nor any thing you are ambitious for poor knaves caps and legs you wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a cause between an orange wife and a fossetseller and then rejourn the controversy of three pence to a second day of audience when you are hearing a matter between party and party if you chance to be pinched with the colic you make faces like mummers set up the bloody flag against all patience and in roaring for a chamberpot dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangled by your hearing all the peace you make in their cause is calling both the parties knaves you are a pair of strange ones our very priests must become mockers if they shall encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are when you speak best unto the purpose it is not worth the wagging of your beards and your beards deserve not so honourable a grave as to stuff a botchers cushion or to be entombed in an asss pack saddle yet you must be saying marcius is proud who in a cheap estimation is worth predecessors since deucalion though peradventure some of the best of em were hereditary hangmen godden to your worships more of your conversation would infect my brain being the herdsmen of the beastly plebeians i will be bold to take my leave of you     how now my as fair as noble ladiesand the moon were she earthly no noblerwhither do you follow your eyes so fast ha marcius coming home take my cap jupiter and i thank thee hoo marcius coming home i will make my very house reel tonight a letter for me a letter for me it gives me an estate of seven years health in which time i will make a lip at the physician the most sovereign prescription in galen is but empiricutic and to this preservative of no better report than a horsedrench is he not wounded he was wont to come home wounded so do i too if it be not too much brings a victory in his pocket the wounds become him has he disciplined aufidius soundly and twas time for him too ill warrant him that an he had stayed by him i would not have been so fidiused for all the chests in corioli and the gold thats in them is the senate possessed of this wondrous ay i warrant you and not without his true purchasing true ill be sworn they are true where is he wounded   god save your good worships marcius is coming home he has more cause to be proud where is he wounded one i the neck and two i the thightheres nine that i know now its twentyseven every gash was an enemys grave   hark the trumpets now the gods crown thee a hundred thousand welcomes i could weep and i could laugh i am light and heavy welcome a curse begin at very root ons heart that is not glad to see thee you are three that rome should dote on yet by the faith of men we have some old crabtrees here at home that will not be grafted to your relish yet welcome warriors we call a nettle but a nettle and the faults of fools but folly having determined of the volsces and to send for titus lartius it remains as the main point of this our aftermeeting to gratify his noble service that hath thus stood for his country therefore please you most reverend and grave elders to desire the present consul and last general in our wellfound successes to report a little of that worthy work performd by caius marcius coriolanus whom we met here both to thank and to remember with honours like himself thats off thats off i would you rather had been silent please you to hear cominius speak he loves your people but tie him not to be their bedfellow worthy cominius speak   nay keep your place pray now sit down masters of the people your multiplying spawn how can he flatter thats thousand to one good onewhen you now see he had rather venture all his limbs for honour than one ons ears to hear it proceed cominius worthy man hes right noble let him be calld for the senate coriolanus are well pleased to make thee consul it then remains that you do speak to the people put them not tot pray you go fit you to the custom and take to you as your predecessors have your honour with your form do not stand upont we recommend to you tribunes of the people our purpose to them and to our noble consul wish we all joy and honour o sir you are not right have you not known the worthiest men have donet o me the gods you must not speak of that you must desire them to think upon you youll mar all ill leave you pray you speak to em i pray you in wholesome manner you have stood your limitation and the tribunes endue you with the peoples voice remains that in the official marks invested you anon do meet the senate ill keep you company will you along the matter be calm be calm lets be calm not now not now well no more what what his choler well well no more of that come enough on both sides more respect what is about to be i am out of breath confusions near i cannot speak you tribunes to the people coriolanus patience speak good sicinius fie fie fie this is the way to kindle not to quench and so are like to do hear me one word beseech you tribunes hear me but a word to brutus  be that you seem truly your countrys friend and temperately proceed to what you would thus violently redress down with that sword tribunes withdraw awhile go get you to your house be gone away all will be naught else sham it be put to that for tis a sore upon us you cannot tent yourself be gone beseech you be gone put not your worthy rage into your tongue one time will owe another pray you be gone ill try whether my old wit be in request with those that have but little this must be patchd with cloth of any colour his nature is too noble for the world he would not flatter neptune for his trident or jove fors power to thunder his hearts his mouth what his breast forges that his tongue must vent and being angry does forget that ever he heard the name of death   heres goodly work i would they were in tiber what the vengeance could he not speak em fair you worthy tribunes sir sir do not cry havoc where you should but hunt with modest warrant hear me speak as i do know the consuls worthiness so can i name his faults the consul coriolanus if by the tribunes leave and yours good people i may be heard i would crave a word or two the which shall turn you to no further harm than so much loss of time now the good gods forbid that our renowned rome whose gratitude towards her deserved children is enrolld in joves own book like an unnatural dam should now eat up her own o hes a limb that has but a disease mortal to cut it off to cure it easy what has he done to rome thats worthy death killing our enemies the blood he hath lost which i dare vouch is more than that he hath by many an ouncehe droppd it for his country and what is left to lose it by his country were to us all that dot and suffer it a brand to the end o the world the service of the foot being once gangrened is not then respected for what before it was one word more one word this tigerfooted rage when it shall find the harm of unscannd swiftness will too late tie leaden pounds tos heels proceed by process lest parties as he is beloved break out and sack great rome with romans consider this he has been bred i the wars since he could draw a sword and is ill schoold in bolted language meal and bran together he throws without distinction give me leave ill go to him and undertake to bring him where he shall answer by a lawful form in peace to his utmost peril ill bring him to you   let me desire your company he must come or what is worst will follow come come you have been too rough something too rough you must return and mend it well said noble woman before he should thus stoop to the herd but that the violent fit o the time craves it as physic for the whole state i would put mine armour on which i can scarcely bear return to the tribunes repent what you have spoke a good demand noble lady come go with us speak fair you may salve so not what is dangerous present but the loss of what is past this but done even as she speaks why their hearts were yours for they have pardons being askd as free as words to little purpose only fair speech ay but mildly calmly i do beseech you a noble wish lo citizens he says he is content the warlike service he has done consider think upon the wounds his body bears which show like graves i the holy churchyard consider further that when he speaks not like a citizen you find him like a soldier do not take his rougher accents for malicious sounds but as i say such as become a soldier rather than envy you nay temperately your promise is this the promise that you made your mother thats worthily as any ear can hear come lets not weep if i could shake off but one seven years from these old arms and legs by the good gods ild with thee every foot peace peace be not so loud come come peace you have told them home and by my troth you have cause youll sup with me fie fie fie hail to you both alls well and might have been much better if he could have temporized nay i hear nothing his mother and his wife hear nothing from him i think not so tis aufidius who hearing of our marcius banishment thrusts forth his horns again into the world which were inshelld when marcius stood for rome and durst not once peep out cannot be we have record that very well it can and three examples of the like have been within my age but reason with the fellow before you punish him where he heard this lest you shall chance to whip your information and beat the messenger who bids beware of what is to be dreaded this is unlikely he and aufidius can no more atone than violentest contrariety what news what news whats the news whats the news pray now your news you have made fair work i fear mepray your news if marcius should be joind with volscians you have made good work you and your apronmen you that stood so up much on the voice of occupation and the breath of garliceaters as hercules did shake down mellow fruit you have made fair work we are all undone unless the noble man have mercy tis true if he were putting to my house the brand that should consume it i have not the face to say beseech you cease you have made fair hands you and your crafts you have crafted fair how was it we we loved him but like beasts and cowardly nobles gave way unto your clusters who did hoot him out o the city here come the clusters and is aufidius with him you are they that made the air unwholesome when you cast your stinking greasy caps in hooting at coriolanus exile now hes coming and not a hair upon a soldiers head which will not prove a whip as many coxcombs as you threw caps up will he tumble down and pay you for your voices tis no matter if he could burn us all into one coal we have deserved it you have made good work you and your cry shalls to the capitol no ill not go you hear what he hath said which was sometime his general who loved him in a most dear particular he calld me father but what o that go you that banishd him a mile before his tent fall down and knee the way into his mercy nay if he coyd to hear cominius speak ill keep at home do you hear why so you have made good work a pair of tribunes that have rackd for rome to make coals cheapa noble memory very well could he say less for one poor grain or two i am one of those his mother wife his child and this brave fellow too we are the grains you are the musty chaff and you are smelt above the moon we must be burnt for you no ill not meddle what should i do well and say that marcius return me as cominius is returnd unheard what then but as a discontented friend griefshot with his unkindness sayt be so ill undertake t i think hell hear me yet to bite his lip and hum at good cominius much unhearts me he was not taken well he had not dined the veins unfilld our blood is cold and then we pout upon the morning are unapt to give or to forgive but when we have stuffd these and these conveyances of our blood with wine and feeding we have suppler souls than in our priestlike fasts therefore ill watch him till he be dieted to my request and then ill set upon him good faith ill prove him speed how it will i shall ere long have knowledge of my success you guard like men tis well but by your leave i am an officer of state and come to speak with coriolanus from rome good my friends if you have heard your general talk of rome and of his friends there it is lots to blanks my name hath touchd your ears it is menenius i tell thee fellow the general is my lover i have been the book of his good acts whence men have read his name unparalleld haply amplified for i have ever verified my friends of whom hes chief with all the size that verity would without lapsing suffer nay sometimes like to a bowl upon a subtle ground i have tumbled past the throw and in his praise have almost stampd the leasing therefore fellow i must have leave to pass prithee fellow remember my name is menenius always factionary on the party of your general has he dined canst thou tell for i would not speak with him till after dinner i am as thy general is sirrah if thy captain knew i were here he would use me with estimation i mean thy general nay but fellow fellow now you companion ill say an errand for you you shall know now that i am in estimation you shall perceive that a jack guardant cannot office me from my son coriolanus guess but by my entertainment with him if thou standest not i the state of hanging or of some death more long in spectatorship and crueller in suffering behold now presently and swoon for whats to come upon thee   the glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy particular prosperity and love thee no worse than thy old father menenius does o my son my son thou art preparing fire for us look thee heres water to quench it i was hardly moved to come to thee but being assured none but myself could move thee i have been blown out of your gates with sighs and conjure thee to pardon rome and thy petitionary countrymen the good gods assuage thy wrath and turn the dregs of it upon this varlet herethis who like a block hath denied my access to thee how away i neither care for the world nor your general for such things as you i can scarce think theres any yere so slight he that hath a will to die by himself fears it not from another let your general do his worst for you be that you are long and your misery increase with your age i say to you as i was said to away see you yond coign o the capitol yond cornerstone if it be possible for you to displace it with your little finger there is some hope the ladies of rome especially his mother may prevail with him but i say there is no hope int our throats are sentenced and stay upon execution there is differency between a grub and a butterfly yet your butterfly was a grub this marcius is grown from man to dragon he has wings hes more than a creeping thing so did he me and he no more remembers his mother now than an eightyearold horse the tartness of his face sours ripe grapes when he walks he moves like an engine and the ground shrinks before his treading he is able to pierce a corslet with his eye talks like a knell and his hum is a battery he sits in his state as a thing made for alexander what he bids be done is finished with his bidding he wants nothing of a god but eternity and a heaven to throne in i paint him in the character mark what mercy his mother shall bring from him there is no more mercy in him than there is milk in a male tiger that shall our poor city find and all this is long of you no in such a case the gods will not be good unto us when we banished him we respected not them and he returning to break our necks they respect not us this is good news i will go meet the ladies this volumnia is worth of consuls senators patricians a city full of tribunes such as you a sea and land full you have prayd well today this morning for ten thousand of your throats id not have given a doit hark how they joythanks whats the matter you dissentious rogues that rubbing the poor itch of your opinion make yourselves scabs he that will give good words to thee will flatter beneath abhorring what would you have you curs that like nor peace nor war the one affrights you the other makes you proud he that trusts to you where he should find you lions finds you hares where foxes geese you are no surer no than is the coal of fire upon the ice or hailstone in the sun your virtue is to make him worthy whose offence subdues him and curse that justice did it who deserves greatness deserves your hate and your affections are a sick mans appetite who desires most that which would increase his evil he that depends upon your favours swims with fins of lead and hews down oaks with rushes hang ye trust ye with every minute you do change a mind and call him noble that was now your hate him vile that was your garland whats the matter that in these several places of the city you cry against the noble senate who under the gods keep you in awe which else would feed on one another whats their seeking hang em they say theyll sit by the fire and presume to know whats done i the capitol whos like to rise who thrives and who declines side factions and give out conjectural marriages making parties strong and feebling such as stand not in their liking below their cobbled shoes they say theres grain enough would the nobility lay aside their ruth and let me use my sword ill make a quarry with thousands of these quarterd slaves as high as i could pick my lance they are dissolved hang em they said they were anhungry sighd forth proverbs that hunger broke stone walls that dogs must eat that meat was made for mouths that the gods sent not corn for the rich men only with these shreds they vented their complainings which being answerd and a petition granted them a strange one to break the heart of generosity and make bold power look palethey threw their caps as they would hang them on the horns o the moon shouting their emulation five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms of their own choice ones junius brutus sicinius velutus and i know notsdeath the rabble should have first unroofd the city ere so prevaild with me it will in time win upon power and throw forth greater themes for insurrections arguing go get you home you fragments here whats the matter i am glad on t then we shall ha means to vent our musty superfluity see our best elders they have a leader tullus aufidius that will put you to t i sin in envying his nobility and were i any thing but what i am i would wish me only he were half to half the world by the ears and he upon my party ild revolt to make only my wars with him he is a lion that i am proud to hunt sir it is and i am constant titus lartius thou shalt see me once more strike at tullus face what art thou stiff standst out nay let them follow the volsces have much corn take these rats thither to gnaw their garners worshipful mutiners your valour puts well forth pray follow yonder comes news a wager they have met tis done say has our general met the enemy ill buy him of you how far off lie these armies then shall we hear their larum and they ours now mars i prithee make us quick in work that we with smoking swords may march from hence to help our fielded friends come blow thy blast   tutus aufidius is he within your walls o they are at it they fear us not but issue forth their city now put your shields before your hearts and fight

Hamlet,whos there long live the king he tis now struck twelve get thee to bed francisco have you had quiet guard well good night if you do meet horatio and marcellus the rivals of my watch bid them make haste say what is horatio there welcome horatio welcome good marcellus i have seen nothing sit down awhile and let us once again assail your ears that are so fortified against our story what we have two nights seen last night of all when yond same star thats westward from the pole had made his course to illume that part of heaven where now it burns marcellus and myself the bell then beating one in the same figure like the king thats dead looks it not like the king  mark it horatio it would be spoke to see it stalks away how now horatio you tremble and look pale is not this something more than fantasy what think you ont i think it be no other but een so well may it sort that this portentous figure comes armed through our watch so like the king that was and is the question of these wars tis here it was about to speak when the cock crew we do my lord armd my lord my lord from head to foot longer longernay answer me stand and unfold yourself bernardo you come most carefully upon your hour for this relief much thanks tis bitter cold and i am sick at heart not a mouse stirring i think i hear them stand ho whos there give you good night bernardo has my place give you good nightfriends to this ground a piece of him tush tush twill not appear well sit we down and let us hear bernardo speak of this most like it harrows me with fear and wonder what art thou that usurpst this time of night together with that fair and warlike form in which the majesty of buried denmark did sometimes march by heaven i charge thee speak stay speak speak i charge thee speak before my god i might not this believe without the sensible and true avouch of mine own eyes as thou art to thyself such was the very armour he had on when he the ambitious norway combated so frownd he once when in an angry parle he smote the sledded polacks on the ice tis strange in what particular thought to work i know not but in the gross and scope of my opinion this bodes some strange eruption to our state that can i at least the whisper goes so our last king whose image even but now appeard to us was as you know by fortinbras of norway thereto prickd on by a most emulate pride dared to the combat in which our valiant hamlet for so this side of our known world esteemd him did slay this fortinbras who by a seald compact well ratified by law and heraldry did forfeit with his life all those his lands which he stood seized of to the conqueror against the which a moiety competent was gaged by our king which had returnd to the inheritance of fortinbras had he been vanquisher as by the same covenant and carriage of the article designd his fell to hamlet now sir young fortinbras of unimproved mettle hot and full hath in the skirts of norway here and there sharkd up a list of lawless resolutes for food and diet to some enterprise that hath a stomach int which is no other as it doth well appear unto our state but to recover of us by strong hand and terms compulsatory those foresaid lands so by his father lost and this i take it is the main motive of our preparations the source of this our watch and the chief head of this posthaste and romage in the land a mote it is to trouble the minds eye in the most high and palmy state of rome a little ere the mightiest julius fell the graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead did squeak and gibber in the roman streets as stars with trains of fire and dews of blood disasters in the sun and the moist star upon whose influence neptunes empire stands was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse and even the like precurse of fierce events as harbingers preceding still the fates and prologue to the omen coming on have heaven and earth together demonstrated unto our climatures and countrymen but soft behold lo where it comes again   ill cross it though it blast me stay illusion if thou hast any sound or use of voice speak to me if there be any good thing to be done that may to thee do ease and grace to me speak to me   if thou art privy to thy countrys fate which happily foreknowing may avoid o speak or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life extorted treasure in the womb of earth for which they say you spirits oft walk in death speak of it stay and speak stop it marcellus do if it will not stand tis here and then it started like a guilty thing upon a fearful summons i have heard the cock that is the trumpet to the morn doth with his lofty and shrillsounding throat awake the god of day and at his warning whether in sea or fire in earth or air the extravagant and erring spirit hies to his confine and of the truth herein this present object made probation so have i heard and do in part believe it but look the morn in russet mantle clad walks oer the dew of yon high eastward hill break we our watch up and by my advice let us impart what we have seen tonight unto young hamlet for upon my life this spirit dumb to us will speak to him do you consent we shall acquaint him with it as needful in our loves fitting our duty hail to your lordship the same my lord and your poor servant ever a truant disposition good my lord my lord i came to see your fathers funeral indeed my lord it followd hard upon where my lord i saw him once he was a goodly king my lord i think i saw him yesternight my lord the king your father season your admiration for awhile with an attent ear till i may deliver upon the witness of these gentlemen this marvel to you two nights together had these gentlemen marcellus and bernardo on their watch in the dead vast and middle of the night been thus encounterd a figure like your father armed at point exactly capape appears before them and with solemn march goes slow and stately by them thrice he walkd by their oppressd and fearsurprised eyes within his truncheons length whilst they distilled almost to jelly with the act of fear stand dumb and speak not to him this to me in dreadful secrecy impart they did and i with them the third night kept the watch where as they had deliverd both in time form of the thing each word made true and good the apparition comes i knew your father these hands are not more like my lord i did but answer made it none yet once methought it lifted up its head and did address itself to motion like as it would speak but even then the morning cock crew loud and at the sound it shrunk in haste away and vanishd from our sight as i do live my honourd lord tis true and we did think it writ down in our duty to let you know of it o yes my lord he wore his beaver up a countenance more in sorrow than in anger nay very pale most constantly it would have much amazed you while one with moderate haste might tell a hundred not when i sawt it was as i have seen it in his life a sable silverd i warrant it will it is a nipping and an eager air i think it lacks of twelve indeed i heard it not then it draws near the season wherein the spirit held his wont to walk   what does this mean my lord is it a custom look my lord it comes it beckons you to go away with it as if it some impartment did desire to you alone no by no means do not my lord what if it tempt you toward the flood my lord or to the dreadful summit of the cliff that beetles oer his base into the sea and there assume some other horrible form which might deprive your sovereignty of reason and draw you into madness think of it the very place puts toys of desperation without more motive into every brain that looks so many fathoms to the sea and hears it roar beneath be ruled you shall not go he waxes desperate with imagination have after to what issue will this come heaven will direct it within  my lord my lord withinheaven secure him within  hillo ho ho my lord what news my lord good my lord tell it not i my lord by heaven there needs no ghost my lord come from the grave to tell us this these are but wild and whirling words my lord theres no offence my lord what ist my lord we will in faith my lord not i propose the oath my lord o day and night but this is wondrous strange here sweet lord at your service o my dear lord well my lord if he steal aught the whilst this play is playing and scape detecting i will pay the theft half a share you might have rhymed very well my lord i did very well note him twere good she were spoken with for she may strew dangerous conjectures in illbreeding minds what are they that would speak with me let them come in   i do not know from what part of the world i should be greeted if not from lord hamlet let him bless thee too reads  horatio when thou shalt have overlooked this give these fellows some means to the king they have letters for him ere we were two days old at sea a pirate of very warlike appointment gave us chase finding ourselves too slow of sail we put on a compelled valour and in the grapple i boarded them on the instant they got clear of our ship so i alone became their prisoner they have dealt with me like thieves of mercy but they knew what they did i am to do a good turn for them let the king have the letters i have sent and repair thou to me with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death i have words to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb yet are they much too light for the bore of the matter these good fellows will bring thee where i am rosencrantz and guildenstern hold their course for england of them i have much to tell thee farewell he that thou knowest thine hamlet come i will make you way for these your letters and dot the speedier that you may direct me to him from whom you brought them custom hath made it in him a property of easiness it might my lord ay my lord not a jot more my lord ay my lord and of calfskins too whats that my lord een so een so my lord twere to consider too curiously to consider so good my lord be quiet remember it my lord that is most certain ist possible i beseech you ay good my lord how was this seald so guildenstern and rosencrantz go tot why what a king is this it must be shortly known to him from england what is the issue of the business there peace who comes here no my good lord ist not possible to understand in another tongue you will dot sir really his purse is empty already alls golden words are spent i knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done this lapwing runs away with the shell on his head you will lose this wager my lord nay good my lord if your mind dislike any thing obey it i will forestall their repair hither and say you are not fit they bleed on both sides how is it my lord never believe it i am more an antique roman than a dane heres yet some liquor left now cracks a noble heart good night sweet prince and flights of angels sing thee to thy rest why does the drum come hither what is it ye would see if aught of woe or wonder cease your search not from his mouth had it the ability of life to thank you he never gave commandment for their death but since so jump upon this bloody question you from the polack wars and you from england are here arrived give order that these bodies high on a stage be placed to the view and let me speak to the yet unknowing world how these things came about so shall you hear of carnal bloody and unnatural acts of accidental judgments casual slaughters of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause and in this upshot purposes mistook falln on the inventors reads all this can i truly deliver of that i shall have also cause to speak and from his mouth whose voice will draw on more but let this same be presently performd even while mens minds are wild lest more mischance on plots and errors happenand liegemen to the dane o farewell honest soldier who hath relieved you holla bernardo what has this thing appeard again tonight horatio says tis but our fantasy and will not let belief take hold of him touching this dreaded sight twice seen of us therefore i have entreated him along with us to watch the minutes of this night that if again this apparition come he may approve our eyes and speak to it peace break thee off look where it comes again thou art a scholar speak to it horatio question it horatio it is offended tis gone and will not answer is it not like the king thus twice before and jump at this dead hour with martial stalk hath he gone by our watch good now sit down and tell me he that knows why this same strict and most observant watch so nightly toils the subject of the land and why such daily cast of brazen cannon and foreign mart for implements of war why such impress of shipwrights whose sore task does not divide the sunday from the week what might be toward that this sweaty haste doth make the night jointlabourer with the day who ist that can inform me shall i strike at it with my partisan tis gone   we do it wrong being so majestical to offer it the show of violence for it is as the air invulnerable and our vain blows malicious mockery it faded on the crowing of the cock some say that ever gainst that season comes wherein our saviours birth is celebrated the bird of dawning singeth all night long and then they say no spirit dares stir abroad the nights are wholesome then no planets strike no fairy takes nor witch hath power to charm so hallowd and so gracious is the time lets dot i pray and i this morning know where we shall find him most conveniently my good lord my lord upon the platform where we watchd look with what courteous action it waves you to a more removed ground but do not go with it you shall not go my lord lets follow tis not fit thus to obey him something is rotten in the state of denmark nay lets follow him withinlord hamlet how ist my noble lord nor i my lord ay by heaven my lord my lord we will not nor i my lord in faith we have sworn my lord alreadythough yet of hamlet our dear brothers death the memory be green and that it us befitted to bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom to be contracted in one brow of woe yet so far hath discretion fought with nature that we with wisest sorrow think on him together with remembrance of ourselves therefore our sometime sister now our queen the imperial jointress to this warlike state have we as twere with a defeated joy with an auspicious and a dropping eye with mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage in equal scale weighing delight and dole taken to wife nor have we herein barrd your better wisdoms which have freely gone with this affair along for all our thanks now follows that you know young fortinbras holding a weak supposal of our worth or thinking by our late dear brothers death our state to be disjoint and out of frame colleagued with the dream of his advantage he hath not faild to pester us with message importing the surrender of those lands lost by his father with all bonds of law to our most valiant brother so much for him now for ourself and for this time of meeting thus much the business is we have here writ to norway uncle of young fortinbras who impotent and bedrid scarcely hears of this his nephews purposeto suppress his further gait herein in that the levies the lists and full proportions are all made out of his subject and we here dispatch you good cornelius and you voltimand for bearers of this greeting to old norway giving to you no further personal power to business with the king more than the scope of these delated articles allow farewell and let your haste commend your duty and can you by no drift of circumstance get from him why he puts on this confusion grating so harshly all his days of quiet with turbulent and dangerous lunacy what do you call the play give me some light away what gertrude how does hamlet alas alas go seek him there hamlet this deed for thine especial safety which we do tender as we dearly grieve for that which thou hast donemust send thee hence with fiery quickness therefore prepare thyself the bark is ready and the wind at help the associates tend and every thing is bent for england what is the cause laertes that thy rebellion looks so giantlike let him go gertrude do not fear our person theres such divinity doth hedge a king that treason can but peep to what it would acts little of his will tell me laertes why thou art thus incensed let him go gertrude speak man dead let him demand his fill good laertes if you desire to know the certainty of your dear fathers death ist writ in your revenge that swoopstake you will draw both friend and foe winner and loser will you know them then now must your conscience my acquaintance seal and you must put me in your heart for friend sith you have heard and with a knowing ear that he which hath your noble father slain pursued my life tis hamlets character naked and in a postscript here he says alone can you advise me if it be so laertes as how should it be so how otherwise will you be ruled by me to thine own peace if he be now returnd as checking at his voyage and that he means no more to undertake it i will work him to an exploit now ripe in my device under the which he shall not choose but fall and for his death no wind of blame shall breathe but even his mother shall uncharge the practise and call it accident a norman the very same not that i think you did not love your father but that i know love is begun by time and that i see in passages of proof time qualifies the spark and fire of it there lives within the very flame of love a kind of wick or snuff that will abate it and nothing is at a like goodness still for goodness growing to a plurisy dies in his own too much that we would do we should do when we would for this would changes and hath abatements and delays as many as there are tongues are hands are accidents and then this should is like a spendthrift sigh that hurts by easing but to the quick o the ulcer hamlet comes back what would you undertake to show yourself your fathers son in deed more than in words lets further think of this weigh what convenience both of time and means may fit us to our shape if this should fail and that our drift look through our bad performance twere better not assayd therefore this project should have a back or second that might hold if this should blast in proof soft let me see well make a solemn wager on your cunnings i hat when in your motion you are hot and dry as make your bouts more violent to that end and that he calls for drink ill have prepared him a chalice for the nonce whereon but sipping if he by chance escape your venomd stuck our purpose may hold there   how now sweet queen pluck them asunder come hamlet come and take this hand from me give them the foils young osric cousin hamlet you know the wager i do not fear it i have seen you both but since he is betterd we have therefore odds set me the stoops of wine upon that table if hamlet give the first or second hit or quit in answer of the third exchange let all the battlements their ordnance fire the king shall drink to hamlets better breath and in the cup an union shall he throw richer than that which four successive kings in denmarks crown have worn give me the cups and let the kettle to the trumpet speak the trumpet to the cannoneer without the cannons to the heavens the heavens to earth now the king dunks to hamlet come begin and you the judges bear a wary eye stay give me drink hamlet this pearl is thine heres to thy health   give him the cup gertrude do not drink part them they are incensed she swounds to see them bleed o yet defend me friends i am but hurtin that and all things will we show our duty most fair return of greetings and desires upon our first he sent out to suppress his nephews levies which to him appeard to be a preparation gainst the polack but better lookd into he truly found it was against your highness whereat grieved that so his sickness age and impotence was falsely borne in hand sends out arrests on fortinbras which he in brief obeys receives rebuke from norway and in fine makes vow before his uncle never more to give the assay of arms against your majesty whereon old norway overcome with joy gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee and his commission to employ those soldiers so levied as before against the polack with an entreaty herein further shown   that it might please you to give quiet pass through your dominions for this enterprise on such regards of safety and allowance as therein are set downwe doubt it nothing heartily farewell   and now laertes whats the news with you you told us of some suit what ist laertes you cannot speak of reason to the dane and loose your voice what wouldst thou beg laertes that shall not be my offer not thy asking the head is not more native to the heart the hand more instrumental to the mouth than is the throne of denmark to thy father what wouldst thou have laertes have you your fathers leave what says polonius take thy fair hour laertes time be thine and thy best graces spend it at thy will but now my cousin hamlet and my son how is it that the clouds still hang on you tis sweet and commendable in your nature hamlet to give these mourning duties to your father but you must know your father lost a father that father lost lost his and the survivor bound in filial obligation for some term to do obsequious sorrow but to persever in obstinate condolement is a course of impious stubbornness tis unmanly grief it shows a will most incorrect to heaven a heart unfortified a mind impatient an understanding simple and unschoold for what we know must be and is as common as any the most vulgar thing to sense why should we in our peevish opposition take it to heart fie tis a fault to heaven a fault against the dead a fault to nature to reason most absurd whose common theme is death of fathers and who still hath cried from the first corse till he that died today this must be so we pray you throw to earth this unprevailing woe and think of us as of a father for let the world take note you are the most immediate to our throne and with no less nobility of love than that which dearest father bears his son do i impart toward you for your intent in going back to school in wittenberg it is most retrograde to our desire and we beseech you bend you to remain here in the cheer and comfort of our eye our chiefest courtier cousin and our son why tis a loving and a fair reply be as ourself in denmark madam come this gentle and unforced accord of hamlet sits smiling to my heart in grace whereof no jocund health that denmark drinks today but the great cannon to the clouds shall tell and the kings rouse the heavens all bruit again respeaking earthly thunder come away welcome dear rosencrantz and guildenstern moreover that we much did long to see you the need we have to use you did provoke our hasty sending something have you heard of hamlets transformation so call it sith nor the exterior nor the inward man resembles that it was what it should be more than his fathers death that thus hath put him so much from the understanding of himself i cannot dream of i entreat you both that being of so young days brought up with him and sith so neighbourd to his youth and havior that you vouchsafe your rest here in our court some little time so by your companies to draw him on to pleasures and to gather so much as from occasion you may glean whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus that opend lies within our remedy thanks rosencrantz and gentle guildenstern thou still hast been the father of good news o speak of that that do i long to hear thyself do grace to them and bring them in   he tells me my dear gertrude he hath found the head and source of all your sons distemper well we shall sift him   welcome my good friends say voltimand what from our brother norway it likes us well and at our more considerd time well read answer and think upon this business meantime we thank you for your welltook labour go to your rest at night well feast together most welcome home but how hath she received his love as of a man faithful and honourable do you think tis this not that i know how may we try it further we will try it with all my heart and it doth much content me to hear him so inclined good gentlemen give him a further edge and drive his purpose on to these delights sweet gertrude leave us too for we have closely sent for hamlet hither that he as twere by accident may here affront ophelia her father and myself lawful espials will so bestow ourselves that seeing unseen we may of their encounter frankly judge and gather by him as he is behaved if t be the affliction of his love or no that thus he suffers for aside          o tis too true how smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience the harlots cheek beautied with plastering art is not more ugly to the thing that helps it than is my deed to my most painted word o heavy burthen love his affections do not that way tend nor what he spake though it lackd form a little was not like madness theres something in his soul oer which his melancholy sits on brood and i do doubt the hatch and the disclose will be some danger which for to prevent i have in quick determination thus set it down he shall with speed to england for the demand of our neglected tribute haply the seas and countries different with variable objects shall expel this somethingsettled matter in his heart whereon his brains still beating puts him thus from fashion of himself what think you ont it shall be so madness in great ones must not unwatchd go how fares our cousin hamlet i have nothing with this answer hamlet these words are not mine have you heard the argument is there no offence in t i like him not nor stands it safe with us to let his madness range therefore prepare you i your commission will forthwith dispatch and he to england shall along with you the terms of our estate may not endure hazard so dangerous as doth hourly grow out of his lunacies arm you i pray you to this speedy voyage for we will fetters put upon this fear which now goes too freefooted thanks dear my lord   o my offence is rank it smells to heaven it hath the primal eldest curse upont a brothers murder pray can i not though inclination be as sharp as will my stronger guilt defeats my strong intent and like a man to double business bound i stand in pause where i shall first begin and both neglect what if this cursed hand were thicker than itself with brothers blood is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens to wash it white as snow whereto serves mercy but to confront the visage of offence and whats in prayer but this twofold force to be forestalled ere we come to fall or pardond being down then ill look up my fault is past but o what form of prayer can serve my turn forgive me my foul murder that cannot be since i am still possessd of those effects for which i did the murder my crown mine own ambition and my queen may one be pardond and retain the offence in the corrupted currents of this world offences gilded hand may shove by justice and oft tis seen the wicked prize itself buys out the law but tis not so above there is no shuffling there the action lies in his true nature and we ourselves compelld even to the teeth and forehead of our faults to give in evidence what then what rests try what repentance can what can it not yet what can it when one can not repent o wretched state o bosom black as death o limed soul that struggling to be free art more engaged help angels make assay bow stubborn knees and heart with strings of steel be soft as sinews of the newborn babe all may be well rising  my words fly up my thoughts remain below words without thoughts never to heaven go theres matter in these sighs these profound heaves you must translate tis fit we understand them where is your son o heavy deed it had been so with us had we been there his liberty is full of threats to all to you yourself to us to every one alas how shall this bloody deed be answerd it will be laid to us whose providence should have kept short restraind and out of haunt this mad young man but so much was our love we would not understand what was most fit but like the owner of a foul disease to keep it from divulging let it feed even on the pith of life where is he gone o gertrude come away the sun no sooner shall the mountains touch but we will ship him hence and this vile deed we must with all our majesty and skill both countenance and excuse ho guildenstern   friends both go join you with some further aid hamlet in madness hath polonius slain and from his mothers closet hath he draggd him go seek him out speak fair and bring the body into the chapel i pray you haste in this   come gertrude well call up our wisest friends and let them know both what we mean to do and whats untimely done o come away my soul is full of discord and dismay i have sent to seek him and to find the body how dangerous is it that this man goes loose yet must not we put the strong law on him hes loved of the distracted multitude who like not in their judgment but their eyes and where tis so the offenders scourge is weighd but never the offence to bear all smooth and even this sudden sending him away must seem deliberate pause diseases desperate grown by desperate appliance are relieved or not at all   how now what hath befalln but where is he bring him before us now hamlet wheres polonius at supper where what dost you mean by this where is polonius ay hamlet so is it if thou knewst our purposes thy loving father hamlet follow him at foot tempt him with speed aboard delay it not ill have him hence tonight away for every thing is seald and done that else leans on the affair pray you make haste   and england if my love thou holdst at aught as my great power thereof may give thee sense since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red after the danish sword and thy free awe pays homage to usthou mayst not coldly set our sovereign process which imports at full by letters congruing to that effect the present death of hamlet do it england for like the hectic in my blood he rages and thou must cure me till i know tis done howeer my haps my joys were neer begun how do you pretty lady conceit upon her father pretty ophelia how long hath she been thus follow her close give her good watch i pray you   o this is the poison of deep grief it springs all from her fathers death o gertrude gertrude when sorrows come they come not single spies but in battalions first her father slain next your son gone and he most violent author of his own just remove the people muddied thick and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers for good polonius death and we have done but greenly in huggermugger to inter him poor ophelia divided from herself and her fair judgment without the which we are pictures or mere beasts last and as much containing as all these her brother is in secret come from france feeds on his wonder keeps himself in clouds and wants not buzzers to infect his ear with pestilent speeches of his fathers death wherein necessity of matter beggard will nothing stick our person to arraign in ear and ear o my dear gertrude this like to a murderingpiece in many places gives me superfluous death where are my switzers let them guard the door   what is the matter the doors are broke who shall stay you why now you speak like a good child and a true gentleman that i am guiltless of your fathers death and am most sensible in grief for it it shall as level to your judgment pierce as day does to your eye laertes i must commune with your grief or you deny me right go but apart make choice of whom your wisest friends you will and they shall hear and judge twixt you and me if by direct or by collateral hand they find us touchd we will our kingdom give our crown our life and all that we can ours to you in satisfaction but if not be you content to lend your patience to us and we shall jointly labour with your soul to give it due content so you shall and where the offence is let the great axe fall i pray you go with me o for two special reasons which may to you perhaps seem much unsinewd but yet to me they are strong the queen his mother lives almost by his looks and for myself my virtue or my plague be it either which shes so conjunctive to my life and soul that as the star moves not but in his sphere i could not but by her the other motive why to a public count i might not go is the great love the general gender bear him who dipping all his faults in their affection would like the spring that turneth wood to stone convert his gyves to graces so that my arrows too slightly timberd for so loud a wind would have reverted to my bow again and not where i had aimd them break not your sleeps for that you must not think that we are made of stuff so flat and dull that we can let our beard be shook with danger and think it pastime you shortly shall hear more i loved your father and we love ourself and that i hop,Tragedy,29

holiday and do you now strew flowers in his way that comes in triumph over pompeys blood be gone run to your houses fall upon your knees pray to the gods to intermit the plague that needs must light on this ingratitude may we do so you know it is the feast of lupercaltruly sir in respect of a fine workman i am but as you would say a cobbler a trade sir that i hope i may use with a safe conscience which is indeed sir a mender of bad soles nay i beseech you sir be not out with me yet if you be out sir i can mend you why sir cobble you truly sir all that i live by is with the awl i meddle with no tradesmans matters nor womens matters but with awl i am indeed sir a surgeon to old shoes when they are in great danger i recover them as proper men as ever trod upon neats leather have gone upon my handiwork truly sir to wear out their shoes to get myself into more work but indeed sir we make holiday to see caesar and to rejoice in his triumphdisrobe the images if you do find them deckd with ceremoniescalpurnia calpurnia stand you directly in antonius way when he doth run his course antonius forget not in your speed antonius to touch calpurnia for our elders say the barren touched in this holy chase shake off their sterile curse set on and leave no ceremony out ha who calls who is it in the press that calls on me i hear a tongue shriller than all the music cry caesar speak caesar is turnd to hear what man is that set him before me let me see his face what sayst thou to me now speak once again he is a dreamer let us leave him pass antonius let me have men about me that are fat sleekheaded men and such as sleep o nights yond cassius has a lean and hungry look he thinks too much such men are dangerous would he were fatter but i fear him not yet if my name were liable to fear i do not know the man i should avoid so soon as that spare cassius he reads much he is a great observer and he looks quite through the deeds of men he loves no plays as thou dost antony he hears no music seldom he smiles and smiles in such a sort as if he mockd himself and scornd his spirit that could be moved to smile at any thing such men as he be never at hearts ease whiles they behold a greater than themselves and therefore are they very dangerous i rather tell thee what is to be feard than what i fear for always i am caesar come on my right hand for this ear is deaf and tell me truly what thou thinkst of him nor heaven nor earth have been at peace tonight thrice hath calpurnia in her sleep cried out help ho they murder caesar whos within go bid the priests do present sacrifice and bring me their opinions of success caesar shall forth the things that threatend me neer lookd but on my back when they shall see the face of caesar they are vanished what can be avoided whose end is purposed by the mighty gods yet caesar shall go forth for these predictions are to the world in general as to caesar cowards die many times before their deaths the valiant never taste of death but once of all the wonders that i yet have heard it seems to me most strange that men should fear seeing that death a necessary end will come when it will come   what say the augurers the gods do this in shame of cowardice caesar should be a beast without a heart if he should stay at home today for fear no caesar shall not danger knows full well that caesar is more dangerous than he we are two lions litterd in one day and i the elder and more terrible and caesar shall go forth mark antony shall say i am not well and for thy humour i will stay at home   heres decius brutus he shall tell them so and you are come in very happy time to bear my greeting to the senators and tell them that i will not come today cannot is false and that i dare not falser i will not come today tell them so decius shall caesar send a lie have i in conquest stretchd mine arm so far to be afraid to tell graybeards the truth decius go tell them caesar will not come the cause is in my will i will not come that is enough to satisfy the senate but for your private satisfaction because i love you i will let you know calpurnia here my wife stays me at home she dreamt tonight she saw my statua which like a fountain with an hundred spouts did run pure blood and many lusty romans came smiling and did bathe their hands in it and these does she apply for warnings and portents and evils imminent and on her knee hath beggd that i will stay at home today and this way have you well expounded it how foolish do your fears seem now calpurnia i am ashamed i did yield to them give me my robe for i will go   and look where publius is come to fetch me welcome publius what brutus are you stirrd so early too good morrow casca caius ligarius caesar was neer so much your enemy as that same ague which hath made you lean what is t oclock i thank you for your pains and courtesy   see antony that revels long o nights is notwithstanding up good morrow antony bid them prepare within i am to blame to be thus waited for now cinna now metellus what trebonius i have an hours talk in store for you remember that you call on me today be near me that i may remember you good friends go in and taste some wine with me and we like friends will straightway go together to the soothsayer  the ides of march are come what touches us ourself shall be last served what is the fellow mad are we all ready what is now amiss that caesar and his senate must redress i must prevent thee cimber these couchings and these lowly courtesies might fire the blood of ordinary men and turn preordinance and first decree into the law of children be not fond to think that caesar bears such rebel blood that will be thawd from the true quality with that which melteth fools i mean sweet words lowcrooked courtsies and base spanielfawning thy brother by decree is banished if thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him i spurn thee like a cur out of my way know caesar doth not wrong nor without cause will he be satisfied what brutus hence wilt thou lift up olympus doth not brutus bootless kneel et tu brute then fall caesarpeace ho caesar speaks bid every noise be still peace yet again you pulld me by the cloak would you speak with me why you were with him were you not why there was a crown offered him and being offered him he put it by with the back of his hand thus and then the people fell ashouting why for that too why for that too ay marry wast and he put it by thrice every time gentler than other and at every puttingby mine honest neighbours shouted why antony i can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it it was mere foolery i did not mark it i saw mark antony offer him a crownyet twas not a crown neither twas one of these coronetsand as i told you he put it by once but for all that to my thinking he would fain have had it then he offered it to him again then he put it by again but to my thinking he was very loath to lay his fingers off it and then he offered it the third time he put it the third time by and still as he refused it the rabblement hooted and clapped their chapped hands and threw up their sweaty nightcaps and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked caesar for he swounded and fell down at it and for mine own part i durst not laugh for fear of opening my lips and receiving the bad air he fell down in the marketplace and foamed at mouth and was speechless i know not what you mean by that but i am sure caesar fell down if the tagrag people did not clap him and hiss him according as he pleased and displeased them as they use to do the players in the theatre i am no true man marry before he fell down when he perceived the common herd was glad he refused the crown he plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his throat to cut an i had been a man of any occupation if i would not have taken him at a word i would i might go to hell among the rogues and so he fell when he came to himself again he said if he had done or said any thing amiss he desired their worships to think it was his infirmity three or four wenches where i stood cried alas good soul and forgave him with all their hearts but theres no heed to be taken of them if caesar had stabbed their mothers they would have done no less ay ay he spoke greek nay an i tell you that ill neer look you i the face again but those that understood him smiled at one another and shook their heads but for mine own part it was greek to me i could tell you more news too marullus and flavius for pulling scarfs off caesars images are put to silence fare you well there was more foolery yet if i could remember it no i am promised forth ay if i be alive and your mind hold and your dinner worth the eating do so farewell both are not you moved when all the sway of earth shakes like a thing unfirm o cicero i have seen tempests when the scolding winds have rived the knotty oaks and i have seen the ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam to be exalted with the threatening clouds but never till tonight never till now did i go through a tempest dropping fire either there is a civil strife in heaven or else the world too saucy with the gods incenses them to send destruction a common slaveyou know him well by sight held up his left hand which did flame and burn like twenty torches joind and yet his hand not sensible of fire remaind unscorchd besidesi ha not since put up my sword against the capitol i met a lion who glared upon me and went surly by without annoying me and there were drawn upon a heap a hundred ghastly women transformed with their fear who swore they saw men all in fire walk up and down the streets and yesterday the bird of night did sit even at noonday upon the marketplace hooting and shrieking when these prodigies do so conjointly meet let not men say these are their reasons they are natural for i believe they are portentous things unto the climate that they point upon he doth for he did bid antonius send word to you he would be there tomorrow farewell cicero a roman your ear is good cassius what night is this who ever knew the heavens menace so but wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens it is the part of men to fear and tremble when the most mighty gods by tokens send such dreadful heralds to astonish us tis caesar that you mean is it not cassius indeed they say the senators tomorrow mean to establish caesar as a king and he shall wear his crown by sea and land in every place save here in italy so can i so every bondman in his own hand bears the power to cancel his captivity you speak to casca and to such a man that is no fleering telltale hold my hand be factious for redress of all these griefs and i will set this foot of mine as far as who goes farthest stand close awhile for here comes one in haste o he sits high in all the peoples hearts and that which would appear offence in us his countenance like richest alchemy will change to virtue and to worthiness no you shall confess that you are both deceived here as i point my sword the sun arises which is a great way growing on the south weighing the youthful season of the year some two months hence up higher toward the north he first presents his fire and the high east stands as the capitol directly here let us not leave him out indeed he is not fit speak hands for me go to the pulpit brutushere my lord what mean you caesar think you to walk forth you shall not stir out of your house today caesar i never stood on ceremonies yet now they fright me there is one within besides the things that we have heard and seen recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch a lioness hath whelped in the streets and graves have yawnd and yielded up their dead fierce fiery warriors fought upon the clouds in ranks and squadrons and right form of war which drizzled blood upon the capitol the noise of battle hurtled in the air horses did neigh and dying men did groan and ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets o caesar these things are beyond all use and i do fear them when beggars die there are no comets seen the heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes alas my lord your wisdom is consumed in confidence do not go forth today call it my fear that keeps you in the house and not your own well send mark antony to the senatehouse and he shall say you are not well today let me upon my knee prevail in this say he is sickcaesar my lord i shall remember when caesar says do this it is performd caesar fear him not caesar hes not dangerous he is a noble roman and well given so to most noble caesar o mighty caesar dost thou lie so low are all thy conquests glories triumphs spoils shrunk to this little measure fare thee well i know not gentlemen what you intend who else must be let blood who else is rank if i myself there is no hour so fit as caesars death hour nor no instrument of half that worth as those your swords made rich with the most noble blood of all this world i do beseech ye if you bear me hard now whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke fulfil your pleasure live a thousand years i shall not find myself so apt to die no place will please me so no mean of death as here by caesar and by you cut off the choice and master spirits of this age i doubt not of your wisdom let each man render me his bloody hand first marcus brutus will i shake with you next caius cassius do i take your hand now decius brutus yours now yours metellus yours cinna and my valiant casca yours though last not last in love yours good trebonius gentlemen allalas what shall i say my credit now stands on such slippery ground that one of two bad ways you must conceit me either a coward or a flatterer that i did love thee caesar o tis true if then thy spirit look upon us now shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death to see thy thy anthony making his peace shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes most noble in the presence of thy corse had i as many eyes as thou hast wounds weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood it would become me better than to close in terms of friendship with thine enemies pardon me julius here wast thou bayd brave hart here didst thou fall and here thy hunters stand signd in thy spoil and crimsond in thy lethe o world thou wast the forest to this hart and this indeed o world the heart of thee how like a deer strucken by many princes dost thou here lie pardon me caius cassius the enemies of caesar shall say this then in a friend it is cold modesty therefore i took your hands but was indeed swayd from the point by looking down on caesar friends am i with you all and love you all upon this hope that you shall give me reasons why and wherein caesar was dangerous thats all i seek and am moreover suitor that i may produce his body to the marketplace and in the pulpit as becomes a friend speak in the order of his funeral be it so i do desire no more o pardon me thou bleeding piece of earth that i am meek and gentle with these butchers thou art the ruins of the noblest man that ever lived in the tide of times woe to the hand that shed this costly blood over thy wounds now do i prophesy which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips to beg the voice and utterance of my tongue a curse shall light upon the limbs of men domestic fury and fierce civil strife shall cumber all the parts of italy blood and destruction shall be so in use and dreadful objects so familiar that mothers shall but smile when they behold their infants quarterd with the hands of war all pity choked with custom of fell deeds and caesars spirit ranging for revenge with ate by his side come hot from hell shall in these confines with a monarchs voice cry  havoc and let slip the dogs of war that this foul deed shall smell above the earth with carrion men groaning for burial   you serve octavius caesar do you not caesar did write for him to come to rome thy heart is big get thee apart and weep passion i see is catching for mine eyes seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine began to water is thy master coming post back with speed and tell him what hath chanced here is a mourning rome a dangerous rome no rome of safety for octavius yet hie hence and tell him so yet stay awhile thou shalt not back till i have borne this corse into the marketplace there shall i try in my oration how the people take the cruel issue of these bloody men according to the which thou shalt discourse to young octavius of the state of things lend me your hand for brutus sake i am beholding to you you gentle romans friends romans countrymen lend me your ears i come to bury caesar not to praise him the evil that men do lives after them the good is oft interred with their bones so let it be with caesar the noble brutus hath told you caesar was ambitious if it were so it was a grievous fault and grievously hath caesar answerd it here under leave of brutus and the rest for brutus is an honourable man so are they all all honourable men come i to speak in caesars funeral he was my friend faithful and just to me but brutus says he was ambitious and brutus is an honourable man he hath brought many captives home to rome whose ransoms did the general coffers fill did this in caesar seem ambitious when that the poor have cried caesar hath wept ambition should be made of sterner stuff yet brutus says he was ambitious and brutus is an honourable man you all did see that on the lupercal i thrice presented him a kingly crown which he did thrice refuse was this ambition yet brutus says he was ambitious and sure he is an honourable man i speak not to disprove what brutus spoke but here i am to speak what i do know you all did love him once not without cause what cause withholds you then to mourn for him o judgment thou art fled to brutish beasts and men have lost their reason bear with me my heart is in the coffin there with caesar and i must pause till it come back to me but yesterday the word of caesar might have stood against the world now lies he there and none so poor to do him reverence o masters if i were disposed to stir your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage i should do brutus wrong and cassius wrong who you all know are honourable men i will not do them wrong i rather choose to wrong the dead to wrong myself and you than i will wrong such honourable men but heres a parchment with the seal of caesar i found it in his closet tis his will let but the commons hear this testament which pardon me i do not mean to read and they would go and kiss dead caesars wounds and dip their napkins in his sacred blood yea beg a hair of him for memory and dying mention it within their wills bequeathing it as a rich legacy unto their issue have patience gentle friends i must not read it it is not meet you know how caesar loved you you are not wood you are not stones but men and being men bearing the will of caesar it will inflame you it will make you mad tis good you know not that you are his heirs for if you should o what would come of it will you be patient will you stay awhile i have oershot myself to tell you of it i fear i wrong the honourable men whose daggers have stabbd caesar i do fear it you will compel me then to read the will then make a ring about the corpse of caesar and let me show you him that made the will shall i descend and will you give me leave nay press not so upon me stand far off if you have tears prepare to shed them now you all do know this mantle i remember the first time ever caesar put it on twas on a summers evening in his tent that day he overcame the nervii look in this place ran cassius dagger through see what a rent the envious casca made through this the wellbeloved brutus stabbd and as he pluckd his cursed steel away mark how the blood of caesar followd it as rushing out of doors to be resolved if brutus so unkindly knockd or no for brutus as you know was caesars angel judge o you gods how dearly caesar loved him this was the most unkindest cut of all for when the noble caesar saw him stab ingratitude more strong than traitors arms quite vanquishd him then burst his mighty heart and in his mantle muffling up his face even at the base of pompeys statua which all the while ran blood great caesar fell o what a fall was there my countrymen then i and you and all of us fell down whilst bloody treason flourishd over us o now you weep and i perceive you feel the dint of pity these are gracious drops kind souls what weep you when you but behold our caesars vesture wounded look you here here is himself marrd as you see with traitors stay countrymen good friends sweet friends let me not stir you up to such a sudden flood of mutiny they that have done this deed are honourable what private griefs they have alas i know not that made them do it they are wise and honourable and will no doubt with reasons answer you i come not friends to steal away your hearts i am no orator as brutus is but as you know me all a plain blunt man that love my friend and that they know full well that gave me public leave to speak of him for i have neither wit nor words nor worth action nor utterance nor the power of speech to stir mens blood i only speak right on i tell you that which you yourselves do know show you sweet caesars wounds poor poor dumb mouths and bid them speak for me but were i brutus and brutus antony there were an antony would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue in every wound of caesar that should move the stones of rome to rise and mutiny yet hear me countrymen yet hear me speak why friends you go to do you know not what wherein hath caesar thus deserved your loves alas you know not i must tell you then you have forgot the will i told you of here is the will and under caesars seal to every roman citizen he gives to every several man seventyfive drachmas hear me with patience moreover he hath left you all his walks his private arbours and newplanted orchards on this side tiber he hath left them you and to your heirs for ever common pleasures to walk abroad and recreate yourselves here was a caesar when comes such another now let it work mischief thou art afoot take thou what course thou wilt   how now fellow where is he and thither will i straight to visit him he comes upon a wish fortune is merry and in this mood will give us any thing belike they had some notice of the people how i had moved them bring me to octavius these many then shall die their names are prickd he shall not live look with a spot i damn him but lepidus go you to caesars house fetch the will hither and we shall determine how to cut off some charge in legacies this is a slight unmeritable man meet to be sent on errands is it fit the threefold world divided he should stand one of the three to share it octavius i have seen more days than you and though we lay these honours on this man to ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads he shall but bear them as the ass bears gold to groan and sweat under the business either led or driven as we point the way and having brought our treasure where we will then take we down his load and turn him off like to the empty ass to shake his ears and graze in commons so is my horse octavius and for that i do appoint him store of provender it is a creature that i teach to fight to wind to stop to run directly on his corporal motion governd by my spirit and in some taste is lepidus but so he must be taught and traind and bid go forth a barrenspirited fellow one that feeds on abjects orts and imitations which out of use and staled by other men begin his fashion do not talk of him but as a property and now octavius listen great thingsbrutus and cassius are levying powers we must straight make head therefore let our alliance be combined our best friends made our means stretchd and let us presently go sit in council how covert matters may be best disclosed and open perils surest answered tut i am in their bosoms and i know wherefore they do it they could be content to visit other places and come down with fearful bravery thinking by this face to fasten in our thoughts that they have courage but tis not so octavius lead your battle softly on upon the left hand of the even field why do you cross me in this exigent no caesar we will answer on their charge make forth the generals would have some words in your bad strokes brutus you give good words witness the hole you made in caesars heart crying long live hail caesar not stingless too villains you did not so when your vile daggers hackd one another in the sides of caesar you showd your teeth like apes and fawnd like hounds and bowd like bondmen kissing caesars feet whilst damned casca like a cur behind struck caesar on the neck o you flatterers old cassius still where is he this is not brutus friend but i assure you a prize no less in worth keep this man safe give him all kindness i had rather have such men my friends than enemies go on and see whether brutus be alive or dead and bring us word unto octavius tent how every thing is chanced this was the noblest roman of them all all the conspirators save only he did that they did in envy of great caesar he only in a general honest thought and common good to all made one of them his life was gentle and the elements so mixd in him that nature might stand up and say to all the world this was a mancaesar beware the ides of march beware the ides of march at mine own house good lady about the ninth hour lady madam not yet i go to take my stand to see him pass on to the capitol that i have lady if it will please caesar to be so good to caesar as to hear me i shall beseech him to befriend himself none that i know will be much that i fear may chance good morrow to you here the street is narrow the throng that follows caesar at the heels of senators of praetors common suitors will crowd a feeble man almost to death ill get me to a place more void and there speak to great caesar as he comes along ay caesar but not gonea soothsayer bids you beware the ides of march not i i am not gamesome i do lack some part of that quick spirit that is in antony let me not hinder cassius your desires ill leave you cassius be not deceived if i have veild my look i turn the trouble of my countenance merely upon myself vexed i am of late with passions of some difference conceptions only proper to myself which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors but let not therefore my good friends be grieved among which number cassius be you one nor construe any further my neglect than that poor brutus with himself at war forgets the shows of love to other men no cassius for the eye sees not itself but by reflection by some other things into what dangers would you lead me cassius that you would have me seek into myself for that which is not in me what means this shouting i do fear the people choose caesar for their king i would not cassius yet i love him well but wherefore do you hold me here so long what is it that you would impart to me if it be aught toward the general good set honour in one eye and death i the other and i will look on both indifferently for let the gods so speed me as i love the name of honour more than i fear death another general shout i do believe that these applauses are for some new honours that are heapd on caesar that you do love me i am nothing jealous what you would work me to i have some aim how i have thought of this and of these times i shall recount hereafter for this present i would not so with love i might entreat you be any further moved what you have said i will consider what you have to say i will with patience hear and find a time both meet to hear and answer such high things till then my noble friend chew upon this brutus had rather be a villager than to repute himself a son of rome under these hard conditions as this time is like to lay upon us the games are done and caesar is returning i will do so but look you cassius the angry spot doth glow on caesars brow and all the rest look like a chidden train calpurnias cheek is pale and cicero looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes as we have seen him in the capitol being crossd in conference by some senators ay casca tell us what hath chanced today that caesar looks so sad i should not then ask casca what had chanced what was the second noise for was the crown offered him thrice tell us the manner of it gentle casca tis very like he hath the failing sickness what said he when he came unto himself and after that he came thus sad away what a blunt fellow is this grown to be he was quick mettle when he went to school and so it is for this time i will leave you tomorrow if you please to speak with me i will come home to you or if you will come home to me and i will wait for you what lucius ho i cannot by the progress of the stars give guess how near to day lucius i say i would it were my fault to sleep so soundly when lucius when awake i say what lucius get me a taper in my study lucius when it is lighted come and call me here it must be by his death and for my part i know no personal cause to spurn at him but for the general he would be crownd how that might change his nature theres the question it is the bright day that brings forth the adder and that craves wary walking crown himthat and then i grant we put a sting in him that at his will he may do danger with the abuse of greatness is when it disjoins remorse from power and to speak truth of caesar i have not known when his affections swayd more than his reason but tis a common proof that lowliness is young ambitions ladder whereto the climberupward turns his face but when he once attains the upmost round he then unto the ladder turns his back looks in the clouds scorning the base degrees by which he did ascend so caesar may then lest he may prevent and since the quarrel will bear no colour for the thing he is fashion it thus that what he is augmented would run to these and these extremities and therefore think him as a serpents egg which hatchd would as his kind grow mischievous and kill him in the shell get you to bed again it is not day is not tomorrow boy the ides of march look in the calendar and bring me word the exhalations whizzing in the air give so much light that i may read by them   brutus thou sleepst awake and see thyself shall rome   c speak strike redress brutus thou sleepst awake such instigations have been often droppd where i have took them up shall rome   c thus must i piece it out shall rome stand under one mans awe what rome my ancestors did from the streets of rome the tarquin drive when he was calld a king speak strike redress am i entreated to speak and strike o rome i make thee promise if the redress will follow thou receivest thy full petition at the hand of brutus tis good go to the gate somebody knocks   since cassius first did whet me against caesar i have not slept between the acting of a dreadful thing and the first motion all the interim is like a phantasma or a hideous dream the g,Tragedy,30

gentle senses see see our honourd hostess the love that follows us sometime is our trouble which still we thank as love herein i teach you how you shall bid god ild us for your pains and thank us for your trouble wheres the thane of cawdor we coursed him at the heels and had a purpose to be his purveyor but he rides well and his great love sharp as his spur hath holp him to his home before us fair and noble hostess we are your guest tonight give me your hand conduct me to mine host we love him highly and shall continue our graces towards him by your leave hostessthis is the sergeant who like a good and hardy soldier fought gainst my captivity hail brave friend say to the king the knowledge of the broil as thou didst leave it the worthy thane of ross my liege they are not yet come back but i have spoke with one that saw him die who did report that very frankly he confessd his treasons implored your highness pardon and set forth a deep repentance nothing in his life became him like the leaving it he died as one that had been studied in his death to throw away the dearest thing he owed as twere a careless trifle o by whom aside to donalbain  why do we hold our tongues that most may claim this argument for ours aside to donalbain        nor our strong sorrow upon the foot of motion what will you do lets not consort with them to show an unfelt sorrow is an office which the false man does easy ill to england this murderous shaft thats shot hath not yet lighted and our safest way is to avoid the aim therefore to horse and let us not be dainty of leavetaking but shift away theres warrant in that theft which steals itself when theres no mercy left let us seek out some desolate shade and there weep our sad bosoms empty what i believe ill wail what know believe and what i can redress as i shall find the time to friend i will what you have spoke it may be so perchance this tyrant whose sole name blisters our tongues was once thought honest you have loved him well he hath not touchd you yet i am young but something you may deserve of him through me and wisdom to offer up a weak poor innocent lamb to appease an angry god but macbeth is a good and virtuous nature may recoil in an imperial charge but i shall crave your pardon that which you are my thoughts cannot transpose angels are bright still though the brightest fell though all things foul would wear the brows of grace yet grace must still look so perchance even there where i did find my doubts why in that rawness left you wife and child those precious motives those strong knots of love without leavetaking i pray you let not my jealousies be your dishonours but mine own safeties you may be rightly just whatever i shall think be not offended i speak not as in absolute fear of you i think our country sinks beneath the yoke it weeps it bleeds and each new day a gash is added to her wounds i think withal there would be hands uplifted in my right and here from gracious england have i offer of goodly thousands but for all this when i shall tread upon the tyrants head or wear it on my sword yet my poor country shall have more vices than it had before more suffer and more sundry ways than ever by him that shall succeed it is myself i mean in whom i know all the particulars of vice so grafted that when they shall be opend black macbeth will seem as pure as snow and the poor state esteem him as a lamb being compared with my confineless harms i grant him bloody luxurious avaricious false deceitful sudden malicious smacking of every sin that has a name but theres no bottom none in my voluptuousness your wives your daughters your matrons and your maids could not fill up the cistern of my lust and my desire all continent impediments would oerbear that did oppose my will better macbeth than such an one to reign with this there grows in my most illcomposed affection such a stanchless avarice that were i king i should cut off the nobles for their lands desire his jewels and this others house and my morehaving would be as a sauce to make me hunger more that i should forge quarrels unjust against the good and loyal destroying them for wealth but i have none the kingbecoming graces as justice verity temperance stableness bounty perseverance mercy lowliness devotion patience courage fortitude i have no relish of them but abound in the division of each several

spoken macduff this noble passion child of integrity hath from my soul wiped the black scruples reconciled my thoughts to thy good truth and honour devilish macbeth by many of these trains hath sought

anoncomes the king forth i pray you i thank you doctor tis calld the evil a most miraculous work in this good king which often since my hereremain in england i have seen him do how he solicits heaven himself best knows but strangelyvisited people all swoln and ulcerous pitiful to the eye the mere despair of surgery he cures hanging a golden stamp about their necks put on with holy prayers and tis spoken to the succeeding royalty he leaves the healing benediction with this strange virtue he hath a heavenly gift of prophecy and sundry blessings hang about his throne that speak him full of grace my countryman but yet i know him not i know him now good god betimes remove the means that makes us strangers whats the newest grief bet their comfort we are coming thither gracious england hath lent us good siward and ten thousand men an older and a better soldier none that christendom gives out merciful heaven what man neer pull your hat upon your brows give sorrow words the grief that does not speak whispers the oerfraught heart and bids it break be comforted lets make us medicines of our great revenge to cure this deadly grief dispute it like a man be this the whetstone of your sword let grief convert to anger blunt not the heart enrage it this tune goes manly come go we to the king our power is ready our lack is nothing but our leave macbeth is ripe for shaking and the powers above put on their instruments receive what cheer you may the night is long that never finds the day cousins i hope the days are near at hand that chambers will be safe let every soldier hew him down a bough and beart before him thereby shall we shadow the numbers of our host and make discovery err in report of us tis his main hope for where there is advantage to be given both more and less have given him the revolt and none serve with him but constrained things whose hearts are absent too now near enough your leafy screens throw down and show like those you are you worthy uncle shall with my cousin your rightnoble son lead our first battle worthy macduff and we shall take upon s what else remains to do according to our order we have met with foes that strike beside us i would the friends

make us even with you my thanes and kinsmen henceforth be earls the first that ever scotland in such an honour named whats more to do which would be planted newly with the time as calling home our exiled friends abroad that fled the snares of watchful tyranny producing forth the cruel ministers of this dead butcher and his fiendlike queen who as tis thought by self and violent hands took off her life this and what needful else that calls upon us by the grace of grace we will perform in measure time and place so thanks to all at once and to each one whom we invite to see us crownd at sconedoubtful it stood as two spent swimmers that do cling together and choke their art the merciless macdonwald worthy to be a rebel for to that the multiplying villanies of nature do swarm upon himfrom the western isles of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied and fortune on his damned quarrel smiling showd like a rebels whore but alls too weak for brave macbethwell he deserves that name disdaining fortune with his brandishd steel which smoked with bloody execution like valours minion carved out his passage till he faced the slave which neer shook hands nor bade farewell to him till he unseamd him from the nave to the chaps and fixd his head upon our battlements as whence the sun gins his reflection shipwrecking storms and direful thunders break so from that spring whence comfort seemd to come discomfort swells mark king of scotland mark no sooner justice had with valour armd compelld these skipping kerns to trust their heels but the norweyan lord surveying vantage with furbishd arms and new supplies of men began a fresh assault yes as sparrows eagles or the hare the lion if i say sooth i must report they were as cannons overcharged with double cracks so they doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds or memorise another golgotha i cannot tell but i am faint my gashes cry for helpwhat a haste looks through his eyes so should he look that seems to speak things strange good morrow noble sir goes the king hence today the night has been unruly where we lay our chimneys were blown down and as they say lamentings heard i the air strange screams of death and prophesying with accents terrible of dire combustion and confused events new hatchd to the woeful time the obscure bird clamourd the livelong night some say the earth was feverous and did shake my young remembrance cannot parallel a fellow to it whats the matter mean you his majesty those of his chamber as it seemd had done t their hands and faces were an badged with blood so were their daggers which unwiped we found upon their pillows they stared and were distracted no mans life was to be trusted with them mayt please your highness sit here is a place reserved sir here my good lord what ist that moves your highness good night and better health attend his majesty my former speeches have but hit your thoughts which can interpret further only i say things have been strangely borne the gracious duncan was pitied of macbeth marry he was dead and the rightvaliant banquo walkd too late whom you may say ift please you fleance killd for fleance fled men must not walk too late who cannot want the thought how monstrous it was for malcolm and for donalbain to kill their gracious father damned fact how it did grieve macbeth did he not straight in pious rage the two delinquents tear that were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep was not that nobly done ay and wisely too for twould have angerd any heart alive to hear the men denyt so that i say he has borne all things well and i do think that had he duncans sons under his key as ant please heaven he shall notthey should find what twere to kill a father so should fleance but peace for from broad words and cause he faild his presence at the tyrants feast i hear macduff lives in disgrace sir can you tell where he bestows himself sent he to macduff and that well might advise him to a caution to hold what distance his wisdom can provide some holy angel fly to the court of england and unfold his message ere he come that a swift blessing may soon return to this our suffering country under a hand accursed whats your graces will no my lord no indeed my lord tis two or three my lord that bring you word macduff is fled to england ay my good lord for certain sir he is not i have a file of all the gentry there is siwards son and many unrough youths that even now protest their first of manhood or so much as it needs to dew the sovereign flower and drown the weeds make we our march towards birnamgod save the king from fife great king where the norweyan banners flout the sky and fan our people cold norway himself with terrible numbers assisted by that most disloyal traitor the thane of cawdor began a dismal conflict till that bellonas bridegroom lappd in proof confronted him with selfcomparisons point against point rebellious arm gainst arm curbing his lavish spirit and to conclude the victory fell on us that now sweno the norways king craves composition nor would we deign him burial of his men till he disbursed at saint colmes inch ten thousand dollars to our general use ill see it done the king hath happily received macbeth the news of thy success and when he reads thy personal venture in the rebels fight his wonders and his praises do contend which should be thine or his silenced with that in viewing oer the rest o the selfsame day he finds thee in the stout norweyan ranks nothing afeard of what thyself didst make strange images of death as thick as hail came post with post and every one did bear thy praises in his kingdoms great defence and pourd them down before him and for an earnest of a greater honour he bade me from him call thee thane of cawdor in which addition hail most worthy thane for it is thine ah good father thou seest the heavens as troubled with mans act threaten his bloody stage by the clock tis day and yet dark night strangles the travelling lamp ist nights predominance or the days shame that darkness does the face of earth entomb when living light should kiss it and duncans horsesa thing most strange and certain beauteous and swift the minions of their race turnd wild in nature broke their stalls flung out contending gainst obedience as they would make war with mankind they did so to the amazement of mine eyes that lookd upont here comes the good macduff   how goes the world sir now ist known who did this more than bloody deed alas the day what good could they pretend gainst nature still thriftless ambition that wilt ravin up thine own lifes means then tis most like the sovereignty will fall upon macbeth where is duncans body will you to scone well i will thither farewell father his absence sir lays blame upon his promise pleaset your highness to grace us with your royal company gentlemen rise his highness is not well what sights my lord you must have patience madam you know not whether it was his wisdom or his fear my dearest coz i pray you school yourself but for your husband he is noble wise judicious and best knows the fits o the season i dare not speak much further but cruel are the times when we are traitors and do not know ourselves when we hold rumour from what we fear yet know not what we fear but float upon a wild and violent sea each way and move i take my leave of you shall not be long but ill be here again things at the worst will cease or else climb upward to what they were before my pretty cousin blessing upon you i am so much a fool should i stay longer it would be my disgrace and your discomfort i take my leave at once sir amen alas poor country almost afraid to know itself it cannot be calld our mother but our grave where nothing but who knows nothing is once seen to smile where sighs and groans and shrieks that rend the air are made not markd where violent sorrow seems a modern ecstasy the dead mans knell is there scarce askd for who and good mens lives expire before the flowers in their caps dying or ere they sicken that of an hours age doth hiss the speaker each minute teems a new one why well well too no they were well at peace when i did leave em when i came hither to transport the tidings which i have heavily borne there ran a rumour of many worthy fellows that were out which was to my belief witnessd the rather for that i saw the tyrants power afoot now is the time of help your eye in scotland would create soldiers make our women fight to doff their dire distresses would i could answer this comfort with the like but i have words that would be howld out in the desert air where hearing should not latch them no mind thats honest but in it shares some woe though the main part pertains to you alone let not your ears despise my tongue for ever which shall possess them with the heaviest sound that ever yet they heard your castle is surprised your wife and babes savagely slaughterd to relate the manner were on the quarry of these murderd deer to add the death of you wife children servants all that could be found i have said your son my lord has paid a soldiers debt he only lived but till he was a man the which no sooner had his prowess confirmd in the unshrinking station where he fought but like a man he died ay and brought off the field your cause of sorrow must not be measured by his worth for then it hath no end ay on the frontkilling swine show me show me all hail macbeth hail to thee thane of cawdor hail not so happy yet much happier thrice and once the hedgepig whined demand showso foul and fair a day i have not seen speak if you can what are you stay you imperfect speakers tell me more by sinels death i know i am thane of glamis but how of cawdor the thane of cawdor lives a prosperous gentleman and to be king stands not within the prospect of belief no more than to be cawdor say from whence you owe this strange intelligence or why upon this blasted heath you stop our way with such prophetic greeting speak i charge you into the air and what seemd corporal melted as breath into the wind would they had stayd your children shall be kings and thane of cawdor too went it not so the thane of cawdor lives why do you dress me in borrowd robes aside  glamis and thane of cawdor the greatest is behind   thanks for your pains   do you not hope your children shall be kings when those that gave the thane of cawdor to me promised no less to them asidetwo truths are told as happy prologues to the swelling act of the imperial themei thank you gentlemen   cannot be ill cannot be good if ill why hath it given me earnest of success commencing in a truth i am thane of cawdor if good why do i yield to that suggestion whose horrid image doth unfix my hair and make my seated heart knock at my ribs against the use of nature present fears are less than horrible imaginings my thought whose murder yet is but fantastical shakes so my single state of man that function is smotherd in surmise and nothing is but what is not aside  if chance will have me king why chance may crown me without my stir aside                come what come may time and the hour runs through the roughest day give me your favour my dull brain was wrought with things forgotten kind gentlemen your pains are registerd where every day i turn the leaf to read them let us toward the king think upon what hath chanced and at more time the interim having weighd it let us speak our free hearts each to other till then enough come friends the service and the loyalty i owe in doing it pays itself your highness part is to receive our duties and our duties are to your throne and state children and servants which do but what they should by doing every thing safe toward your love and honour the rest is labour which is not used for you ill be myself the harbinger and make joyful the hearing of my wife with your approach so humbly take my leave aside  the prince of cumberland that is a step on which i must fall down or else oerleap for in my way it lies stars hide your fires let not light see my black and deep desires the eye wink at the hand yet let that be which the eye fears when it is done to see they met me in the day of success and i have learned by the perfectest report they have more in them than mortal knowledge when i burned in desire to question them further they made themselves air into which they vanished whiles i stood rapt in the wonder of it came missives from the king who allhailed me thane of cawdor by which title before these weird sisters saluted me and referred me to the coming on of time with hail king that shalt be this have i thought good to deliver thee my dearest partner of greatness that thou mightst not lose the dues of rejoicing by being ignorant of what greatness is promised thee lay it to thy heart and farewell glamis thou art and cawdor and shalt be what thou art promised yet do i fear thy nature it is too full o the milk of human kindness to catch the nearest way thou wouldst be great art not without ambition but without the illness should attend it what thou wouldst highly that wouldst thou holily wouldst not play false and yet wouldst wrongly win thouldst have great glamis that which cries thus thou must do if thou have it and that which rather thou dost fear to do than wishest should be undone hie thee hither that i may pour my spirits in thine ear and chastise with the valour of my tongue all that impedes thee from the golden round which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem to have thee crownd withal   what is your tidings my dearest love duncan comes here tonight and when goes hence tomorrow as he purposes we will speak further only look up clear to alter favour ever is to fear leave all the rest to me if it were done when tis done then twere well it were done quickly if the assassination could trammel up the consequence and catch with his surcease success that but this blow might be the beall and the endall here but here upon this bank and shoal of time weld jump the life to come but in these cases we still have judgment here that we but teach bloody instructions which being taught return to plague the inventor this evenhanded justice commends the ingredients of our poisond chalice to our own lips hes here in double trust first as i am his kinsman and his subject strong both against the deed then as his host who should against his murderer shut the door not bear the knife myself besides this duncan hath borne his faculties so meek hath been so clear in his great office that his virtues will plead like angels trumpettongued against the deep damnation of his takingoff and pity like a naked newborn babe striding the blast or heavens cherubim horsed upon the sightless couriers of the air shall blow the horrid deed in every eye that tears shall drown the wind i have no spur to prick the sides of my intent but only vaulting ambition which oerleaps itself and falls on the other   how now what news hath he askd for me know you not he has we will proceed no further in this business he hath honourd me of late and i have bought golden opinions from all sorts of people which would be worn now in their newest gloss not cast aside so soon prithee peace i dare do all that may become a man who dares do more is none if we should fail bring forth menchildren only for thy undaunted mettle should compose nothing but males will it not be received when we have markd with blood those sleepy two of his own chamber and used their very daggers that they have donet i am settled and bend up each corporal agent to this terrible feat away and mock the time with fairest show false face must hide what the false heart doth know a friend being unprepared our will became the servant to defect which else should free have wrought i think not of them yet when we can entreat an hour to serve we would spend it in some words upon that business if you would grant the time if you shall cleave to my consent when tis it shall make honour for you good repose the while go bid thy mistress when my drink is ready she strike upon the bell get thee to bed   is this a dagger which i see before me the handle toward my hand come let me clutch thee i have thee not and yet i see thee still art thou not fatal vision sensible to feeling as to sight or art thou but a dagger of the mind a false creation proceeding from the heatoppressed brain i see thee yet in form as palpable as this which now i draw thou marshallst me the way that i was going and such an instrument i was to use mine eyes are made the fools o the other senses or else worth all the rest i see thee still and on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood which was not so before theres no such thing it is the bloody business which informs thus to mine eyes now oer the one halfworld nature seems dead and wicked dreams abuse the curtaind sleep witchcraft celebrates pale hecates offerings and witherd murder alarumd by his sentinel the wolf whose howls his watch thus with his stealthy pace with tarquins ravishing strides towards his design moves like a ghost thou sure and firmset earth hear not my steps which way they walk for fear thy very stones prate of my whereabout and take the present horror from the time which now suits with it whiles i threat he lives words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives   i go and it is done the bell invites me hear it not duncan for it is a knell that summons thee to heaven or to hell that which hath made them drunk hath made me bold what hath quenchd them hath given me fire hark peace it was the owl that shriekd the fatal bellman which gives the sternst goodnight he is about it the doors are open and the surfeited grooms do mock their charge with snores i have druggd their possets that death and nature do contend about them whether they live or die within  whos there what ho i have done the deed didst thou not hear a noise when as i descended ay hark who lies i the second chamber this is a sorry sight a foolish thought to say a sorry sight theres one did laugh ins sleep and one cried murder that they did wake each other i stood and heard them but they did say their prayers and addressd them again to sleep one cried god bless us and amen the other as they had seen me with these hangmans hands listening their fear i could not say amen when they did say god bless us but wherefore could not i pronounce amen i had most need of blessing and amen stuck in my throat these deeds must not be thought after these ways so it will make us mad methought i heard a voice cry sleep no more macbeth does murder sleep the innocent sleep sleep that knits up the ravelld sleeve of care the death of each days life sore labours bath balm of hurt minds great natures second course chief nourisher in lifes feast still it cried sleep no more to all the house glamis hath murderd sleep and therefore cawdor shall sleep no more macbeth shall sleep no more ill go no more

neptunes ocean wash this blood clean from my hand no this my hand will rather the multitudinous seas in incarnadine making the green one red my hands are of your colour but i shame to wear a heart so white   i hear a knocking at the south entry retire we to our ,Tragedy,32
Othello,tush never tell me i take it much unkindly that thou iago who hast had my purse as if the strings were thine shouldst know of this thou toldst me thou didst hold him in thy hate by heaven i rather would have been his hangman i would not follow him then what a full fortune does the thicklips owe if he can carryt thus here is her fathers house ill call aloud what ho brabantio signior brabantio ho signior is all your family within most reverend signior do you know my voice my name is roderigo sir sir sir patience good sir most grave brabantio in simple and pure soul i come to you sir i will answer any thing but i beseech you ift be your pleasure and most wise consent as partly i find it is that your fair daughter at this oddeven and dull watch o the night transported with no worse nor better guard but with a knave of common hire a gondolier to the gross clasps of a lascivious moor if this be known to you and your allowance we then have done you bold and saucy wrongs but if you know not this my manners tell me we have your wrong rebuke do not believe that from the sense of all civility i thus would play and trifle with your reverence your daughter if you have not given her leave i say again hath made a gross revolt tying her duty beauty wit and fortunes in an extravagant and wheeling stranger of here and every where straight satisfy yourself if she be in her chamber or your house let loose on me the justice of the state for thus deluding you truly i think they are yes sir i have indeed i think i can discover him if you please to get good guard and go along with me signior it is the moor iago what will i do thinkest thou i will incontinently drown myself it is silliness to live when to live is torment and then have we a prescription to die when death is our physician what should i do i confess it is my shame to be so fond but it is not in my virtue to amend it it cannot be wilt thou be fast to my hopes if i depend on the issue where shall we meet i the morning ill be with thee betimes what say you i am changed ill go sell all my land with him why tis not possible i cannot believe that in her shes full of most blessed condition yes that i did but that was but courtesy well i will do this if i can bring it to any opportunity adieu beat me i do follow here in the chase not like a hound that hunts but one that fills up the cry my money is almost spent i have been tonight exceedingly well cudgelled and i think the issue will be i shall have so much experience for my pains and so with no money at all and a little more wit return again to venice i do not find that thou dealest justly with me every day thou daffest me with some device iago and rather as it seems to me now keepest from me all conveniency than suppliest me with the least advantage of hope i will indeed no longer endure it nor am i yet persuaded to put up in peace what already i have foolishly suffered faith i have heard too much for your words and performances are no kin together with nought but truth i have wasted myself out of my means the jewels you have had from me to deliver to desdemona would half have corrupted a votarist you have told me she hath received them and returned me expectations and comforts of sudden respect and acquaintance but i find none very well go to i cannot go to man nor tis not very well nay i think it is scurvy and begin to find myself fobbed in it i tell you tis not very well i will make myself known to desdemona if she will return me my jewels i will give over my suit and repent my unlawful solicitation if not assure yourself i will seek satisfaction of you ay and said nothing but what i protest intendment of doing it hath not appeared well what is it is it within reason and compass is that true why then othello and desdemona return again to venice how do you mean removing of him and that you would have me to do i will hear further reason for this be near at hand i may miscarry int i have no great devotion to the deed and yet he hath given me satisfying reasons tis but a man gone forth my sword he dies i know his gait tis hevillain thou diest o i am slain o villain that i am o wretched villain nobody come then shall i bleed to death o help me here o damnd iago o inhuman dogsblood but you will not hear me if ever i did dream of such a matter abhor me despise me if i do not three great ones of the city in personal suit to make me his lieutenant offcappd to him and by the faith of man i know my price i am worth no worse a place but he as loving his own pride and purposes evades them with a bombast circumstance horribly stuffd with epithets of war and in conclusion nonsuits my mediators for certes says he i have already chose my officer and what was he forsooth a great arithmetician one michael cassio a florentine a fellow almost damnd in a fair wife that never set a squadron in the field nor the division of a battle knows more than a spinster unless the bookish theoric wherein the toged consuls can propose as masterly as he mere prattle without practise is all his soldiership but he sir had the election and i of whom his eyes had seen the proof at rhodes at cyprus and on other grounds christian and heathen must be beleed and calmd by debitor and creditor this countercaster he in good time must his lieutenant be and igod bless the markhis moorships ancient why theres no remedy tis the curse of service preferment goes by letter and affection and not by old gradation where each second stood heir to the first now sir be judge yourself whether i in any just term am affined to love the moor o sir content you i follow him to serve my turn upon him we cannot all be masters nor all masters cannot be truly followd you shall mark many a duteous and kneecrooking knave that doting on his own obsequious bondage wears out his time much like his masters ass for nought but provender and when hes old cashierd whip me such honest knaves others there are who trimmd in forms and visages of duty keep yet their hearts attending on themselves and throwing but shows of service on their lords do well thrive by them and when they have lined their coats do themselves homage these fellows have some soul and such a one do i profess myself for sir it is as sure as you are roderigo were i the moor i would not be iago in following him i follow but myself heaven is my judge not i for love and duty but seeming so for my peculiar end for when my outward action doth demonstrate the native act and figure of my heart in compliment extern tis not long after but i will wear my heart upon my sleeve for daws to peck at i am not what i am call up her father rouse him make after him poison his delight proclaim him in the streets incense her kinsmen and though he in a fertile climate dwell plague him with flies though that his joy be joy yet throw such changes of vexation ont as it may lose some colour do with like timorous accent and dire yell as when by night and negligence the fire is spied in populous cities awake what ho brabantio thieves thieves thieves look to your house your daughter and your bags thieves thieves are your doors lockd zounds sir youre robbd for shame put on your gown your heart is burst you have lost half your soul even now now very now an old black ram is topping your white ewe arise arise awake the snorting citizens with the bell or else the devil will make a grandsire of you arise i say zounds sir you are one of those that will not serve god if the devil bid you because we come to do you service and you think we are ruffians youll have your daughter covered with a barbary horse youll have your nephews neigh to you youll have coursers for cousins and gennets for germans i am one sir that comes to tell you your daughter and the moor are now making the beast with two backs you area senator farewell for i must leave you it seems not meet nor wholesome to my place to be producedas if i stay i shall against the moor for i do know the state however this may gall him with some cheque cannot with safety cast him for hes embarkd with such loud reason to the cyprus wars which even now stand in act that for their souls another of his fathom they have none to lead their business in which regard though i do hate him as i do hellpains yet for necessity of present life i must show out a flag and sign of love which is indeed but sign that you shall surely find him lead to the sagittary the raised search and there will i be with him so farewell though in the trade of war i have slain men yet do i hold it very stuff o the conscience to do no contrived murder i lack iniquity sometimes to do me service nine or ten times i had thought to have yerkd him here under the ribs nay but he prated and spoke such scurvy and provoking terms against your honour that with the little godliness i have i did full hard forbear him but i pray you sir are you fast married be assured of this that the magnifico is much beloved and hath in his effect a voice potential as double as the dukes he will divorce you or put upon you what restraint and grievance the law with all his might to enforce it on will give him cable those are the raised father and his friends you were best go in by janus i think no faith he tonight hath boarded a land carack if it prove lawful prize hes made for ever hes married marry tocome captain will you go it is brabantio general be advised he comes to bad intent you roderigo come sir i am for you what sayst thou noble heart why go to bed and sleep if thou dost i shall never love thee after why thou silly gentleman o villainous i have looked upon the world for four times seven years and since i could distinguish betwixt a benefit and an injury i never found man that knew how to love himself ere i would say i would drown myself for the love of a guineahen i would change my humanity with a baboon virtue a fig tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus our bodies are our gardens to the which our wills are gardeners so that if we will plant nettles or sow lettuce set hyssop and weed up thyme supply it with one gender of herbs or distract it with many either to have it sterile with idleness or manured with industry why the power and corrigible authority of this lies in our wills if the balance of our lives had not one scale of reason to poise another of sensuality the blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us to most preposterous conclusions but we have reason to cool our raging motions our carnal stings our unbitted lusts whereof i take this that you call love to be a sect or scion it is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the will come be a man drown thyself drown cats and blind puppies i have professed me thy friend and i confess me knit to thy deserving with cables of perdurable toughness i could never better stead thee than now put money in thy purse follow thou the wars defeat thy favour with an usurped beard i say put money in thy purse it cannot be that desdemona should long continue her love to the moor put money in thy pursenor he his to her it was a violent commencement and thou shalt see an answerable sequestrationput but money in thy purse these moors are changeable in their wills fill thy purse with moneythe food that to him now is as luscious as locusts shall be to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida she must change for youth when she is sated with his body she will find the error of her choice she must have change she must therefore put money in thy purse if thou wilt needs damn thyself do it a more delicate way than drowning make all the money thou canst if sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian and a supersubtle venetian not too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell thou shalt enjoy her therefore make money a pox of drowning thyself it is clean out of the way seek thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than to be drowned and go without her thou art sure of mego make moneyi have told thee often and i retell thee again and again i hate the moor my cause is hearted thine hath no less reason let us be conjunctive in our revenge against him if thou canst cuckold him thou dost thyself a pleasure me a sport there are many events in the womb of time which will be delivered traverse go provide thy money we will have more of this tomorrow adieu at my lodging go to farewell do you hear roderigo no more of drowning do you hear thus do i ever make my fool my purse for i mine own gaind knowledge should profane if i would time expend with such a snipe but for my sport and profit i hate the moor and it is thought abroad that twixt my sheets he has done my office i know not ift be true but i for mere suspicion in that kind will do as if for surety he holds me well the better shall my purpose work on him cassios a proper man let me see now to get his place and to plume up my will in double knaveryhow how lets see after some time to abuse othellos ear that he is too familiar with his wife he hath a person and a smooth dispose to be suspected framed to make women false the moor is of a free and open nature that thinks men honest that but seem to be so and will as tenderly be led by the nose as asses are i havet it is engenderd hell and night must bring this monstrous birth to the worlds light sir would she give you so much of her lips as of her tongue she oft bestows on me youll have enough in faith too much i find it still when i have list to sleep marry before your ladyship i grant she puts her tongue a little in her heart and chides with thinking come on come on you are pictures out of doors bells in your parlors wildcats in your kitchens saints m your injuries devils being offended players in your housewifery and housewives in your beds nay it is true or else i am a turk you rise to play and go to bed to work no let me not o gentle lady do not put me tot for i am nothing if not critical ay madam i am about it but indeed my invention comes from my pate as birdlime does from frize it plucks out brains and all but my muse labours and thus she is deliverd if she be fair and wise fairness and wit the ones for use the other useth it if she be black and thereto have a wit shell find a white that shall her blackness fit she never yet was foolish that was fair for even her folly helpd her to an heir theres none so foul and foolish thereunto but does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do she that was ever fair and never proud had tongue at will and yet was never loud never lackd gold and yet went never gay fled from her wish and yet said now i may she that being angerd her revenge being nigh bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly she that in wisdom never was so frail to change the cods head for the salmons tail she that could think and neer disclose her mind see suitors following and not look behind she was a wight if ever such wight were to suckle fools and chronicle small beer aside  he takes her by the palm ay well said whisper with as little a web as this will i ensnare as great a fly as cassio ay smile upon her do i will gyve thee in thine own courtship you say true tis so indeed if such tricks as these strip you out of your lieutenantry it had been better you had not kissed your three fingers so oft which now again you are most apt to play the sir in very good well kissed an excellent courtesy tis so indeed yet again your fingers to your lips would they were clysterpipes for your sake   the moor i know his trumpet aside  o you are well tuned now but ill set down the pegs that make this music as honest as i am do thou meet me presently at the harbour come hither if thou best valiant as they say base men being in love have then a nobility in their natures more than is native to themlist me the lieutenant tonight watches on the court of guardfirst i must tell thee thisdesdemona is directly in love with him lay thy finger thus and let thy soul be instructed mark me with what violence she first loved the moor but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies and will she love him still for prating let not thy discreet heart think it her eye must be fed and what delight shall she have to look on the devil when the blood is made dull with the act of sport there should be again to inflame it and to give satiety a fresh appetite loveliness in favour sympathy in years manners and beauties all which the moor is defective in now for want of these required conveniences her delicate tenderness will find itself abused begin to heave the gorge disrelish and abhor the moor very nature will instruct her in it and compel her to some second choice now sir this grantedas it is a most pregnant and unforced positionwho stands so eminent in the degree of this fortune as cassio does a knave very voluble no further conscionable than in putting on the mere form of civil and humane seeming for the better compassing of his salt and most hidden loose affection why none why none a slipper and subtle knave a finder of occasions that has an eye can stamp and counterfeit advantages though true advantage never present itself a devilish knave besides the knave is handsome young and hath all those requisites in him that folly and green minds look after a pestilent complete knave and the woman hath found him already blessed figsend the wine she drinks is made of grapes if she had been blessed she would never have loved the moor blessed pudding didst thou not see her paddle with the palm of his hand didst not mark that lechery by this hand an index and obscure prologue to the history of lust and foul thoughts they met so near with their lips that their breaths embraced together villanous thoughts roderigo when these mutualities so marshal the way hard at hand comes the master and main exercise the incorporate conclusion pish but sir be you ruled by me i have brought you from venice watch you tonight for the command ill layt upon you cassio knows you not ill not be far from you do you find some occasion to anger cassio either by speaking too loud or tainting his discipline or from what other course you please which the time shall more favourably minister sir he is rash and very sudden in choler and haply may strike at you provoke him that he may for even out of that will i cause these of cyprus to mutiny whose qualification shall come into no true taste again but by the displanting of cassio so shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by the means i shall then have to prefer them and the impediment most profitably removed without the which there were no expectation of our prosperity i warrant thee meet me by and by at the citadel i must fetch his necessaries ashore farewell that cassio loves her i do well believe it that she loves him tis apt and of great credit the moor howbeit that i endure him not is of a constant loving noble nature and i dare think hell prove to desdemona a most dear husband now i do love her too not out of absolute lust though peradventure i stand accountant for as great a sin but partly led to diet my revenge for that i do suspect the lusty moor hath leapd into my seat the thought whereof doth like a poisonous mineral gnaw my inwards and nothing can or shall content my soul till i am evend with him wife for wife or failing so yet that i put the moor at least into a jealousy so strong that judgment cannot cure which thing to do if this poor trash of venice whom i trash for his quick hunting stand the putting on ill have our michael cassio on the hip abuse him to the moor in the rank garb for i fear cassio with my nightcap too make the moor thank me love me and reward me for making him egregiously an ass and practising upon his peace and quiet even to madness tis here but yet confused knaverys plain face is never seen tin used not this hour lieutenant tis not yet ten o the clock our general cast us thus early for the love of his desdemona who let us not therefore blame he hath not yet made wanton the night with her and she is sport for jove and ill warrant her fun of game what an eye she has methinks it sounds a parley of provocation and when she speaks is it not an alarum to love well happiness to their sheets come lieutenant i have a stoup of wine and here without are a brace of cyprus gallants that would fain have a measure to the health of black othello o they are our friends but one cup ill drink for you what man tis a night of revels the gallants desire it here at the door i pray you call them in if i can fasten but one cup upon him with that which he hath drunk tonight already hell be as full of quarrel and offence as my young mistress dog now my sick fool roderigo whom love hath turnd almost the wrong side out to desdemona hath tonight caroused potations pottledeep and hes to watch three lads of cyprus noble swelling spirits that hold their honours in a wary distance the very elements of this warlike isle have i tonight flusterd with flowing cups and they watch too now mongst this flock of drunkards am i to put our cassio in some action that may offend the islebut here they come if consequence do but approve my dream my boat sails freely both with wind and stream some wine ho   and let me the canakin clink clink and let me the canakin clink a soldiers a man a lifes but a span why then let a soldier drink some wine boys i learned it in england where indeed they are most potent in potting your dane your german and your swagbellied hollanderdrink hoare nothing to your english why he drinks you with facility your dane dead drunk he sweats not to overthrow your almain he gives your hollander a vomit ere the next pottle can be filled o sweet england king stephen was a worthy peer his breeches cost him but a crown he held them sixpence all too dear with that he calld the tailor lown he was a wight of high renown and thou art but of low degree tis pride that pulls the country down then take thine auld cloak about thee some wine ho will you heart again its true good lieutenant and so do i too lieutenant you see this fellow that is gone before he is a soldier fit to stand by caesar and give direction and do but see his vice tis to his virtue a just equinox the one as long as the other tis pity of him i fear the trust othello puts him in on some odd time of his infirmity will shake this island tis evermore the prologue to his sleep hell watch the horologe a double set if drink rock not his cradle aside to him  how now roderigo i pray you after the lieutenant go not i for this fair island i do love cassio well and would do much to cure him of this evilbut hark what noise aside to roderigo  away i say go out and cry a mutiny   nay good lieutenantalas gentlemen help holieutenantsirmontanosir help mastersheres a goodly watch indeed   whos that which rings the belldiablo ho the town will rise gods will lieutenant hold you will be shamed for ever hold ho lieutenantsirmontanogentlemen have you forgot all sense of place and duty hold the general speaks to you hold hold for shame i do not know friends all but now even now in quarter and in terms like bride and groom devesting them for bed and then but now as if some planet had unwitted men swords out and tilting one at others breast in opposition bloody i cannot speak any beginning to this peevish odds and would in action glorious i had lost those legs that brought me to a part of it touch me not so near i had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth than it should do offence to michael cassio yet i persuade myself to speak the truth shall nothing wrong him thus it is general montano and myself being in speech there comes a fellow crying out for help and cassio following him with determined sword to execute upon him sir this gentleman steps in to cassio and entreats his pause myself the crying fellow did pursue lest by his clamouras it so fell out the town might fall in fright he swift of foot outran my purpose and i returnd the rather for that i heard the clink and fall of swords and cassio high in oath which till tonight i neer might say before when i came back for this was briefi found them close together at blow and thrust even as again they were when you yourself did part them more of this matter cannot i report but men are men the best sometimes forget though cassio did some little wrong to him as men in rage strike those that wish them best yet surely cassio i believe received from him that fled some strange indignity which patience could not pass what are you hurt lieutenant marry heaven forbid as i am an honest man i thought you had received some bodily wound there is more sense in that than in reputation reputation is an idle and most false imposition oft got without merit and lost without deserving you have lost no reputation at all unless you repute yourself such a loser what man there are ways to recover the general again you are but now cast in his mood a punishment more in policy than in malice even so as one would beat his offenceless dog to affright an imperious lion sue to him again and hes yours what was he that you followed with your sword what had he done to you ist possible why but you are now well enough how came you thus recovered come you are too severe a moraler as the time the place and the condition of this country stands i could heartily wish this had not befallen but since it is as it is mend it for your own good come come good wine is a good familiar creature if it be well used exclaim no more against it and good lieutenant i think you think i love you you or any man living may be drunk at a time man ill tell you what you shall do our generals wife is now the general may say so in this respect for that he hath devoted and given up himself to the contemplation mark and denotement of her parts and graces confess yourself freely to her importune her help to put you in your place again she is of so free so kind so apt so blessed a disposition she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more than she is requested this broken joint between you and her husband entreat her to splinter and my fortunes against any lay worth naming this crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before i protest in the sincerity of love and honest kindness you are in the right good night lieutenant i must to the watch cassio good night honest iago and whats he then that says i play the villain when this advice is free i give and honest probal to thinking and indeed the course to win the moor again for tis most easy the inclining desdemona to subdue in any honest suit shes framed as fruitful as the free elements and then for her to win the moorweret to renounce his baptism all seals and symbols of redeemed sin his soul is so enfetterd to her love that she may make unmake do what she list even as her appetite shall play the god with his weak function how am i then a villain to counsel cassio to this parallel course directly to his good divinity of hell when devils will the blackest sins put on they do suggest at first with heavenly shows as i do now for whiles this honest fool plies desdemona to repair his fortunes and she for him pleads strongly to the moor ill pour this pestilence into his ear that she repeals him for her bodys lust and by how much she strives to do him good she shall undo her credit with the moor so will i turn her virtue into pitch and out of her own goodness make the net that shall enmesh them all   how now roderigo how poor are they that have not patience what wound did ever heal but by degrees thou knowst we work by wit and not by witchcraft and wit depends on dilatory time doest not go well cassio hath beaten thee and thou by that small hurt hast cashierd cassio though other things grow fair against the sun yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe content thyself awhile by the mass tis morning pleasure and action make the hours seem short retire thee go where thou art billeted away i say thou shalt know more hereafter nay get thee gone   two things are to be done my wife must move for cassio to her mistress ill set her on myself the while to draw the moor apart and bring him jump when he may cassio find soliciting his wife ay thats the way dull not device by coldness and delay you have not been abed then ill send her to you presently and ill devise a mean to draw the moor out of the way that your converse and business may be more free well my good lord ill dot ha i like not that nothing my lord or ifi know not what cassio my lord no sure i cannot think it that he would steal away so guiltylike seeing you coming my noble lord did michael cassio when you wood my lady know of your love but for a satisfaction of my thought no further harm i did not think he had been acquainted with her indeed honest my lord my lord for aught i know think my lord my lord you know i love you for michael cassio i dare be sworn i think that he is honest men should be what they seem or those that be not would they might seem none why then i think cassios an honest man good my lord pardon me though i am bound to every act of duty i am not bound to that all slaves are free to utter my thoughts why say they are vile and false as wheres that palace whereinto foul things sometimes intrude not who has a breast so pure but some uncleanly apprehensions keep leets and lawdays and in session sit with meditations lawful i do beseech you though i perchance am vicious in my guess as i confess it is my natures plague to spy into abuses and oft my jealousy shapes faults that are notthat your wisdom yet from one that so imperfectly conceits would take no notice nor build yourself a trouble out of his scattering and unsure observance it were not for your quiet nor your good nor for my manhood honesty or wisdom to let you know my thoughts good name in man and woman dear my lord is the immediate jewel of their souls who steals my purse steals trash tis something nothing twas mine tis his and has been slave to thousands but he that filches from me my good name robs me of that which not enriches him and makes me poor indeed you cannot if my heart were in your hand nor shall not whilst tis in my custody o beware my lord of jealousy it is the greeneyed monster which doth mock the meat it feeds on that cuckold lives in bliss who certain of his fate loves not his wronger but o what damned minutes tells he oer who dotes yet doubts suspects yet strongly loves poor and content is rich and rich enough but riches fineless is as poor as winter to him that ever fears he shall be poor good heaven the souls of all my tribe defend from jealousy i am glad of it for now i shall have reason to show the love and duty that i bear you with franker spirit therefore as i am bound receive it from me i speak not yet of proof look to your wife observe her well with cassio wear your eye thus not jealous nor secure i would not have your free and noble nature out of selfbounty be abused look tot i know our country disposition well in venice they do let heaven see the pranks they dare not show their husbands their best conscience is not to leavet undone but keept unknown she did deceive her father marrying you and when she seemd to shake and fear your looks she loved them most why go to then she that so young could give out such a seeming to seal her fathers eyes up close as oak he thought twas witchcraftbut i am much to blame i humbly do beseech you of your pardon for too much loving you i see this hath a little dashd your spirits i faith i fear it has i hope you will consider what is spoke comes from my love but i do see youre moved i am to pray you not to strain my speech to grosser issues nor to larger reach than to suspicion should you do so my lord my speech should fall into such vile success as my thoughts aim not at cassios my worthy friend my lord i see youre moved long live she so and long live you to think so ay theres the point asto be bold with you not to affect many proposed matches of her own clime complexion and degree whereto we see in all things nature tends foh one may smell in such a will most rank foul disproportion thoughts unnatural but pardon me i do not in position distinctly speak of her though i may fear her will recoiling to her better judgment may fall to match you with her country forms and happily repent going  my lord i take my leave returning  my lord i would i might entreat your honour to scan this thing no further leave it to time though it be fit that cassio have his place for sure he fills it up with great ability yet if you please to hold him off awhile you shall by that perceive him and his means note if your lady strain his entertainment with any strong or vehement importunity much will be seen in that in the mean time let me be thought too busy in my fears as worthy cause i have to fear i am and hold her free i do beseech your honour i once more take my leave how now what do you here alone a thing

dexterity retorts it romeo he cries aloud hold friends friends part and swifter than his tongue his agile arm beats down their fatal points and twixt them rushes underneath whose arm an envious thrust

unhappy wretched hateful day most miserable hour that eer time saw in lasting labour of his pilgrimage but one poor one one poor and loving child but one thing to rejoice and solace in and cruel death hath catchd it from my sight the people in the street cry romeo some juliet and some paris and all run with open outcry toward our monument o me this sight of death is as a bell that warns my old age to a sepulchrethou villain capulethold me not let me go who set this ancient quarrel new abroach speak nephew were you by when it began many a morning hath he there been seen with tears augmenting the fresh morning dew adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs but all so soon as the allcheering sun should in the furthest east begin to draw the shady curtains from auroras bed away from the light steals home my heavy son and private in his chamber pens himself shuts up his windows locks far daylight out and makes himself an artificial night black and portentous must this humour prove unless good counsel may the cause remove i neither know it nor can learn of him both by myself and many other friends but he his own affections counsellor is to himselfi will not say how true but to himself so secret and so close so far from sounding and discovery as is the bud bit with an envious worm ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air or dedicate his beauty to the sun could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow we would as willingly give cure as know i would thou wert so happy by thy stay to hear true shrift come madam lets away not romeo prince he was mercutios friend his fault concludes but what the law should end the life of tybalt alas my liege my wife is dead tonight grief of my sons exile hath stoppd her breath what further woe conspires against mine age o thou untaught what manners is in this to press before thy father to a grave but i can give thee more for i will raise her statue in pure gold that while verona by that name is known there shall no figure at such rate be set as that of true and faithful julietthou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe o where is romeo saw you him today right glad i am he was not at this frayrebellious subjects enemies to peace profaners of this neighbourstained steel will they not hear what ho you men you beasts that quench the fire of your pernicious rage with purple fountains issuing from your veins on pain of torture from those bloody hands throw your mistemperd weapons to the ground and hear the sentence of your moved prince three civil brawls bred of an airy word by thee old capulet and montague have thrice disturbd the quiet of our streets and made veronas ancient citizens cast by their grave beseeming ornaments to wield old partisans in hands as old cankerd with peace to part your cankerd hate if ever you disturb our streets again your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace for this time all the rest depart away you capulet shall go along with me and montague come you this afternoon to know our further pleasure in this case to old freetown our common judgmentplace once more on pain of death all men depart where are the vile beginners of this fray benvolio who began this bloody fray romeo slew him he slew mercutio who now the price of his dear blood doth owe and for that offence immediately we do exile him hence i have an interest in your hates proceeding my blood for your rude brawls doth lie ableeding but ill amerce you with so strong a fine that you shall all repent the loss of mine i will be deaf to pleading and excuses nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses therefore use none let romeo hence in haste else when hes found that hour is his last bear hence this body and attend our will mercy but murders pardoning those that kill what misadventure is so early up that calls our person from our mornings rest what fear is this which startles in our ears search seek and know how this foul murder comes come montague for thou art early up to see thy son and heir more early down look and thou shalt see seal up the mouth of outrage for a while till we can clear these ambiguities and know their spring their head their true descent and then will i be general of your woes and lead you even to death meantime forbear and let mischance be slave to patience bring forth the parties of suspicion then say at once what thou dost know in this we still have known thee for a holy man wheres romeos man what can he say in this give me the letter i will look on it where is the countys page that raised the watch sirrah what made your master in this place this letter doth make good the friars words their course of love the tidings of her death and here he writes that he did buy a poison of a poor pothecary and therewithal came to this vault to die and lie with juliet where be these enemies capulet montague see what a scourge is laid upon your hate that heaven finds means to kill your joys with love and i for winking at your discords too have lost a brace of kinsmen all are punishd a glooming peace this morning with it brings the sun for sorrow will not show his head go hence to have more talk of these sad things some shall be pardond and some punished for never was a story of more woe than this of juliet and her romeois the day so young ay me sad hours seem long was that my father that went hence so fast not having that which having makes them short out out of her favour where i am in love alas that love whose view is muffled still should without eyes see pathways to his will where shall we dine o me what fray was here yet tell me not for i have heard it all heres much to do with hate but more with love why then o brawling love o loving hate o any thing of nothing first create o heavy lightness serious vanity misshapen chaos of wellseeming forms feather of lead bright smoke cold fire sick health stillwaking sleep that is not what it is this love feel i that feel no love in this dost thou not laugh good heart at what why such is loves transgression griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast which thou wilt propagate to have it prest with more of thine this love that thou hast shown doth add more grief to too much of mine own love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs being purged a fire sparkling in lovers eyes being vexd a sea nourishd with lovers tears what is it else a madness most discreet a choking gall and a preserving sweet farewell my coz tut i have lost myself i am not here this is not romeo hes some other where what shall i groan and tell thee bid a sick man in sadness make his will ah word ill urged to one that is so ill in sadness cousin i do love a woman a right good markman and shes fair i love well in that hit you miss shell not be hit with cupids arrow she hath dians wit and in strong proof of chastity well armd from loves weak childish bow she lives unharmd she will not stay the siege of loving terms nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes nor ope her lap to saintseducing gold o she is rich in beauty only poor that when she dies with beauty dies her store she hath and in that sparing makes huge waste for beauty starved with her severity cuts beauty off from all posterity she is too fair too wise wisely too fair to merit bliss by making me despair she hath forsworn to love and in that vow do i live dead that live to tell it now o teach me how i should forget to think tis the way to call hers exquisite in question more these happy masks that kiss fair ladies brows being black put us in mind they hide the fair he that is strucken blind cannot forget the precious treasure of his eyesight lost show me a mistress that is passing fair what doth her beauty serve but as a note where i may read who passd that passing fair farewell thou canst not teach me to forget your

Timon of Athens,good day sir i have not seen you long how goes the world ay thats well known but what particular rarity what strange which manifold record not matches see magic of bounty all these spirits thy power hath conjured to attend i know the merchant reciting to himself  when we for recompense have praised the vile it stains the glory in that happy verse which aptly sings the good a thing slippd idly from me our poesy is as a gum which oozes from whence tis nourishd the fire i the flint shows not till it be struck our gentle flame provokes itself and like the current flies each bound it chafes what have you there upon the heels of my presentment sir lets see your piece so tis this comes off well and excellent admirable how this grace speaks his own standing what a mental power this eye shoots forth how big imagination moves in this lip to the dumbness of the gesture one might interpret i will say of it it tutors nature artificial strife lives in these touches livelier than life the senators of athens happy man you see this confluence this great flood of visitors i have in this rough work shaped out a man whom this beneath world doth embrace and hug with amplest entertainment my free drift halts not particularly but moves itself in a wide sea of wax no levelld malice infects one comma in the course i hold but flies an eagle flight bold and forth on leaving no tract behind i will unbolt to you you see how all conditions how all minds as well of glib and slippery creatures as of grave and austere quality tender down their services to lord timon his large fortune upon his good and gracious nature hanging subdues and properties to his love and tendance all sorts of hearts yea from the glassfaced flatterer to apemantus that few things loves better than to abhor himself even he drops down the knee before him and returns in peace most rich in timons nod sir i have upon a high and pleasant hill feignd fortune to be throned the base o the mount is rankd with all deserts all kind of natures that labour on the bosom of this sphere to propagate their states amongst them all whose eyes are on this sovereign lady fixd one do i personate of lord timons frame whom fortune with her ivory hand wafts to her whose present grace to present slaves and servants translates his rivals nay sir but hear me on all those which were his fellows but of late some better than his value on the moment follow his strides his lobbies fill with tendance rain sacrificial whisperings in his ear make sacred even his stirrup and through him drink the free air when fortune in her shift and change of mood spurns down her late beloved all his dependants which labourd after him to the mountains top even on their knees and hands let him slip down not one accompanying his declining foot vouchsafe my labour and long live your lordship how now philosopher art not one then i lie not yes thats not feigned he is so whats to be thought of him does the rumour hold for true that hes so full of gold then this breaking of his has been but a try for his friends what have you now to present unto him i must serve him so too tell him of an intent thats coming toward him i am thinking what i shall say i have provided for him it must be a personating of himself a satire against the softness of prosperity with a discovery of the infinite flatteries that follow youth and opulency nay lets seek him then do we sin against our own estate when we may profit meet and come too late hail worthy timon sir having often of your open bounty tasted hearing you were retired your friends falln off whose thankless natureso abhorred spirits not all the whips of heaven are large enough what to you whose starlike nobleness gave life and influence to their whole being i am rapt and cannot cover the monstrous bulk of this ingratitude with any size of words nor ii am glad youre well it wears sir as it grows i know them both th others a jeweller you are rapt sir in some work some dedication to the great lord a picture sir when comes your book forth tis a good piece indifferent it is a pretty mocking of the life here is a touch ist good how this lord is followd look more how shall i understand you i saw them speak together tis conceived to scope this throne this fortune and this hill methinks with one man beckond from the rest below bowing his head against the sleepy mount to climb his happiness would be well expressd in our condition ay marry what of these tis common a thousand moral paintings i can show that shall demonstrate these quick blows of fortunes more pregnantly than words yet you do well to show lord timon that mean eyes have seen the foot above the head a piece of painting which i do beseech your lordship to accept the gods preserve ye youre a dog as i took note of the place it cannot be far where he abides certain alcibiades reports it phrynia and timandra had gold of him he likewise enriched poor straggling soldiers with great quantity tis said he gave unto his steward a mighty sum nothing else you shall see him a palm in athens again and flourish with the highest therefore tis not amiss we tender our loves to him in this supposed distress of his it will show honestly in us and is very likely to load our purposes with what they travail for if it be a just true report that goes of his having nothing at this time but my visitation only i will promise him an excellent piece good as the best promising is the very air o the time it opens the eyes of expectation performance is ever the duller for his act and but in the plainer and simpler kind of people the deed of saying is quite out of use to promise is most courtly and fashionable performance is a kind of will or testament which argues a great sickness in his judgment that makes it true when the day serves before blackcornerd night find what thou wantst by free and offerd light come our late noble master he and myself have travaild in the great shower of your gifts and sweetly felt it we are hither come to offer you our service so it is said my noble lord but therefore came not my friend nor i so so my lord i know none such my lordo tis a

him after fare you well freely good father i have so what of him attends he here or no lucilius well what further the man is honest does she love him to lucilius           love you the maid how shall she be endowd if she be mated with an equal husband this gentleman of mine hath served me long to build his fortune i will strain a little for tis a bond in men give him thy daughter what you bestow in him ill counterpoise and make him weigh with her my hand to thee mine honour on my promise i thank you you shall hear from me anon go not away what have you there my friend painting is welcome the

to set a gloss on faint deeds hollow welcomes recanting goodness sorry ere tis shown but where there is true friendship there needs none pray sit more welcome are ye to my fortunes than my fortunes to me o apemantus you are welcome fie thourt a churl yeve got a humour there does not become a man tis much to blame they say my lords ira furor brevis est but yond man is ever angry go let him have a table by himself for he does neither affect company nor is he fit fort indeed i take no heed of thee thourt an athenian therefore welcome i myself would have no power prithee let my meat make thee silent my lord in heart and let the health go round captain alcibiades your hearts in the field now you had rather be at a breakfast of enemies than a dinner of friends o no doubt my good friends but the gods themselves have provided that i shall have much help from you how had you been my friends else why have you that charitable title from thousands did not you chiefly belong to my heart i have told more of you to myself than you can with modesty speak in your own behalf and thus far i confirm you o you gods think i what need we have any friends if we should neer have need of em they were the most needless creatures living should we neer have use for em and would most resemble sweet instruments hung up in cases that keep their sounds to themselves why i have often wished myself poorer that i might come nearer to you we are born to do benefits and what better or properer can we can our own than the riches of our friends o what a precious comfort tis to have so many like brothers

trifle of our love and now i remember my lord you gave good words the other day of a bay courser i rode on it is yours because you liked it you may take my word my lord i know no man can justly praise but what he does affect i weigh my friends affection with mine own ill tell you true ill call to you i take all and your several visitations so kind to heart tis not enough to give methinks i could

know that the people of rome for whom we stand a special party have by common voice in election for the roman empery chosen andronicus surnamed pius for many good and great deserts to rome a nobler man a braver warrior lives not this day within the city walls he by the senate is accitd home from weary wars against the barbarous goths that with his sons a terror to our foes hath yoked a nation strong traind up in arms ten years are spent since first he undertook this cause of rome and chastised with arms our enemies pride five times he hath returnd bleeding to rome bearing his valiant sons in coffins from the field and now at last laden with horrors spoils returns the good andronicus to rome renowned titus flourishing in arms let us entreat by honour of his name whom worthily you would have now succeed and in the capitol and senates right whom you pretend to honour and adore that you withdraw you and abate your strength dismiss your followers and as suitors should plead your deserts in peace and humbleness and welcome nephews from successful wars you that survive and you that sleep in fame fair lords your fortunes are alike in all that in your countrys service drew your swords

lord to step out of these dreary dumps how comes it that the subtle queen of goths is of a sudden thus advanced in rome that on mine honour here i do protest this was thy daughter o that delightful engine of her thoughts that blabbd them with such pleasing eloquence is torn from forth that pretty hollow cage where like a sweet melodious bird it sung sweet varied notes enchanting every ear o thus i found her straying in the park seeking to hide herself as doth the deer that hath received some unrecuring wound perchance she weeps because they killd her husband perchance because she knows them innocent patience dear niece good titus dry thine eyes which of your hands hath not defended rome and reard aloft the bloody battleaxe writing destruction on the enemys castle o none of both but are of high desert my hand hath been but idle let it serve to ransom my two nephews from their death then have i kept it to a worthy end my hand shall go and for our fathers sake and mothers care now let

thought for two and twenty sons i never wept because they died in honours lofty bed   for these these tribunes in the dust i write my hearts deep languor and my souls sad tears let my tears stanch the earths dry appetite my sons sweet blood will make it shame and blush o earth i will befriend thee more with rain that shall distil from these two ancient urns than youthful april shall with all his showers in summers drought ill drop upon thee still in winter with warm tears ill melt the snow and keep eternal springtime on thy face so thou refuse to drink my dear sons blood   o reverend tribunes o gentle aged men unbind my sons reverse the doom of death and let me say that never wept before my tears are now prevailing orators ah lucius for thy brothers let me plead grave tribunes once more i entreat of you why tis no matter man if they did hear they would not mark me or if they did mark they would not pity me yet plead i must therefore i tell my sorrows to the stones who though they cannot answer my distress yet in some sort they are better than the tribunes for that they will not intercept my tale when i do weep they humbly at my feet receive my tears and seem to weep with me and were they but attired in grave weeds rome could afford no tribune like to these a stone is soft as waxtribunes more hard than stones a stone is silent and offendeth not and tribunes with their tongues doom men to death   but wherefore standst thou with thy weapon drawn o happy man they have befriended thee why foolish lucius dost thou not perceive that rome is but a wilderness of tigers tigers must prey and rome affords no prey but me and mine how happy art thou then from these devourers to be banished but who comes with our brother marcus here will it consume me let me see it then fainthearted boy arise and look upon her speak lavinia what accursed hand hath made thee handless in thy fathers sight what fool hath added water to the sea or brought a faggot to brightburning troy my grief was at the height before thou camest and now like nilus it disdaineth bounds give me a sword ill chop off my hands too for they have fought for rome and all in vain and they have nursed this woe in feeding life in bootless prayer have they been held up and they have served me to effectless use now all the service i require of them is that the one will help to cut the other tis well lavinia that thou hast no hands for hands to do rome service are but vain it was my deer and he that wounded her hath hurt me more than had he killed me dead for now i stand as one upon a rock environed with a wilderness of sea who marks the waxing tide grow wave by wave expecting ever when some envious surge will in his brinish bowels swallow him this way to death my wretched sons are gone here stands my other son a banished man and here my brother weeping at my woes but that which gives my soul the greatest spurn is dear lavinia dearer than my soul had i but seen thy picture in this plight it would have madded me what shall i do now i behold thy lively body so thou hast no hands to wipe away thy tears nor tongue to tell me who hath martyrd thee thy husband he is dead and for his death thy brothers are condemnd and dead by this look marcus ah son lucius look on her when i did name her brothers then fresh tears stood on her cheeks as doth the honeydew upon a gatherd lily almost witherd if they did kill thy husband then be joyful because the law hath taen revenge on them no no they would not do so foul a deed witness the sorrow that their sister makes gentle lavinia let me kiss thy lips or make some sign how i may do thee ease shall thy good uncle and thy brother lucius and thou and i sit round about some fountain looking all downwards to behold our cheeks how they are staind as meadows yet not dry with miry slime left on them by a flood and in the fountain shall we gaze so long till the fresh taste be taken from that clearness and made a brinepit with our bitter tears or shall we cut away our hands like thine or shall we bite our tongues and in dumb shows pass the remainder of our hateful days what shall we do let us that have our tongues plot some deuce of further misery to make us wonderd at in time to come ah marcus marcus brother well i wot thy napkin cannot drink a tear of mine for thou poor man hast drownd it with thine own mark marcus mark i understand her signs had she a tongue to speak now would she say that to her brother which i said to thee his napkin with his true tears all bewet can do no service on her sorrowful cheeks o what a sympathy of woe is this as far from help as limbo is from bliss o gracious emperor o gentle aaron did ever raven sing so like a lark that gives sweet tidings of the suns uprise with all my heart ill send the emperor my hand good aaron wilt thou help to chop it off sirs strive no more such witherd herbs as these are meet for plucking up and therefore mine agree between you i will spare my hand o here i lift this one hand up to heaven and bow this feeble ruin to the earth if any power pities wretched tears to that i call   what wilt thou kneel with me do then dear heart for heaven shall hear our prayers or with our sighs well breathe the welkin dim and stain the sun with fog as sometime clouds when they do hug him in their melting bosoms is not my sorrow deep having no bottom then be my passions bottomless with them if there were reason for these miseries then into limits could i bind my woes when heaven doth weep doth not the earth oerflow if the winds rage doth not the sea wax mad threatening the welkin with his bigswoln face and wilt thou have a reason for this coil i am the sea hark how her sighs do blow she is the weeping welkin i the earth then must my sea be moved with her sighs then must my earth with her continual tears become a deluge overflowd and drownd for why my bowels cannot hide her woes but like a drunkard must i vomit them then give me leave for losers will have leave to ease their stomachs with their bitter tongues when will this fearful slumber have an end ha ha ha why i have not another tear to shed besides this sorrow is an enemy and would usurp upon my watery eyes and make them blind with tributary tears then which way shall i find revenges cave for these two heads do seem to speak to me and threat me i shall never come to bliss till all these mischiefs be returnd again even in their throats that have committed them come let me see what task i have to do you heavy people circle me about that i may turn me to each one of you and swear unto my soul to right your wrongs the vow is made come brother take a head and in this hand the other i will bear lavinia thou shalt be employd these arms bear thou my hand sweet wench between thy teeth as for thee boy go get thee from my sight thou art an exile and thou must not stay hie to the goths and raise an army there and if you love me as i think you do lets kiss and part for we have much to do so so now sit and look you eat no more than will preserve just so much strength in us as will revenge these bitter woes of ours marcus unknit that sorrowwreathen knot thy niece and i poor creatures want our hands and cannot passionate our tenfold grief with folded arms this poor right hand of mine is left to tyrannize upon my breast who when my heart all mad with misery beats in this hollow prison of my flesh then thus i thump it down   thou map of woe that thus dost talk in signs when thy poor heart beats with outrageous beating thou canst not strike it thus to make it still wound it with sighing girl kill it with groans or get some little knife between thy teeth and just against thy heart make thou a hole that all the tears that thy poor eyes let fall may run into that sink and soaking in drown the lamenting fool in seasalt tears how now has sorrow made thee dote already why marcus no man should be mad but i what violent hands can she lay on her life ah wherefore dost thou urge the name of hands to bid aeneas tell t,Tragedy,36
